> A 1-cell a • f✲b • in a bicategory B is called an equivalence if there exists a 1-cell b • g✲a • such that g◦f ∼= 1a and f ◦g ∼= 1b

> In a sense, coherence axioms are a price to be paid for the increased expressive power originated by weakening the defining structural properties. Think, for example, of the coherence diagram for associativity in definition §6. It identifies the basic ways in which the composition of 4 arrows can be parenthesised and relates them through a. To ensure that all such ways are unique is precisely the reason to enforce the commutativity of the diagram. By such a coherence axiom one knows that, in a bicategory, any two natural isomorphisms built out of a, r and l, by the composition and unit operations, actually coincide. That is to say, weakening has caused no special (calculational) damage.

> This is the broader context of n-categories [Bae97], whose basic claim is that equations should hold on the nose (i.e., up to equality) only at the top level, i.e., between n-cells. . Therefore laws concerning k-cells, for k < n, should always be expressed as (k + 1)-equivalences. In this context an equivalence between (n − 1)-cells is an invertible n-cell whereas an equivalence between k-cells, for k < n, is just a (k + 1)-cell invertible up to equivalence.

> The pentagon axiom is the ‘associahedron’ K4, whose vertices
are each possible parenthesised word on four letters such that the letters appear in the same
order, and edges are an application of associativity. Its commutativity asserts that there is no
ambiguity between the two possible ways to transform an expression involving four horizontally
composed 1-cells bracketed to the left to one bracketed to the right, while the triangle axiom
asserts that there is no ambiguity between the two ways to collapse the unit if it appears in the
middle of an expression involving horizontally composed 1-cells.

> A category is called skeletal if it has no non-identity isomorphisms. With the axiom of
choice, one can show that every small category is equivalent to its skeleton.

> An enriched category is a category in which the hom-functors take their values
not in Set, but in some other category V . The theory of enriched categories is now
very well developed, and Cat-category theory is the special case where V = Cat. In
Cat-category theory one deals with higher-dimensional versions of the usual notions
of functor, limit, monad, and so on, without any “weakening”. The passage from
category theory to Cat-category theory is well understood; unfortunately Catcategory theory is generally not what one wants to do — it is too strict, and fails
to deal with the notions that arise in practice.
In bicategory theory all of these notions are weakened. One never says that
arrows are equal, only isomorphic, or even sometimes only that there is a comparison 2-cell between them. If one wishes to generalize a result about categories to
bicategories, it is generally clear in principle what should be done, but the details
can be technically very difficult.

> Monads are monoid objects for Compose, and applicatives are monoid objects for Day. So in Hask, I think we have a natural transformation Day f f ~> Compose f f which corresponds to ap essentially. This turns any Compose-monoid into a Day-monoid, but I'm not sure if this mapping can be expressed in any category, so maybe that's the issue there?

> Also, Day convolution does not really work in a general CCC. Even in Set, Day convolution of arbitrary functors does not exist in general, but at least you can restrict yourself to accessible functors (which you can approximate in haskell as "strictly positive functors").

> Also I don't know what you mean by saying day convolution doesn't work in general. Definitionally its just a kan extension making use of a category with suitable monoidal structure, which Set most certainly has!?

> As for Day convolution, yes, it is a left Kan extension of something involving the monoidal structure, but that doesn't mean that it always exists, just like Kan extensions don't always exist. If you take the formula for a pointwise Kan extension as a coend, the domain of the coend is large (Set itself), so even though Set is cocomplete, you can't conclude that it exists.

> On Day convolution I think see your point -- the coend formula works if you're in a sufficiently (co)complete setting, not universally.

> The first, and perhaps most important, point is that hardly any categories that occur in nature are skeletal. The axiom of choice implies that every category is equivalent to a skeletal one, but such a skeleton is usually artifical and non-canonical. Thus, even if using skeletal categories simplified category theory, it would not mean that the subtleties were artifical, but rather that the naturally occurring subtleties could be removed by an artificial construction (the skeleton).

> Another solution to many of the same problems has been known for a while: free monads and extensible effects. As it happens, capability and free monads can be formally compared. In this paper, Mauro Jaskelioff and Russell O'Connor, prove that free monads are a special case of capabilities (it's not phrased in these terms, of course, but that's what the paper amounts to).

> Swierstra notes that by summing together functors representing primitive I/O actions and taking the free monad of that sum, we can produce values use multiple I/O feature sets. Values defined on a subset of features can be lifted into the free monad generated by the sum. The equivalent process can be performed with the van Laarhoven free monad by taking the product of records of the primitive operations. Values defined on a subset of features can be lifted by composing the van Laarhoven free monad with suitable projection functions that pick out the requisite primitive operations. No doubt someone will develop a library implementing a type class(y) hierarchy to make this process transparent, which may or may not be a good idea.

> A monoidal category M may be regarded as a bicategory BM with a single object ∙. The objects A of M become 1-cells [A]:∙→∙ of BM; these are composed across the 0-cell ∙ using the definition [A]∘0[B]=[A⊗B], using the monoidal product ⊗ of M. The identity 1-cell ∙→∙ is [I], where I is the monoidal unit of M. The morphisms f:A→B become 2-cells [f]:[A]→[B] of BM. The associativity and unit constraints of the monoidal category M transfer straightforwardly to associativity and unit data of the bicategory BM. The construction is a special case of delooping (see there).

> Up to equivalence [seems important!] you may assume that all equivalent pairs of j-morphisms for j>n are in fact equal, and many authorities include this as a requirement. On the other hand, you can also write down a definition of n-category from scratch (without passing through ∞-categories), and then this question never comes up. The point is that you don't talk about j-morphisms for j>n; you stop at n-morphisms.

[(infinity,0)-category](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%28infinity%2C0%29-category)

> So in an (∞,0)-category every morphism is an equivalence. Such ∞-categories are usually called ∞-groupoids.

> This is directly analogous to how a 0-category is equivalent to a set, a (1,0)-category is equivalent to a groupoid, and so on. (In general, an (n,0)-category is equivalent to an n-groupoid.)

[0-category](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/0-category)

> A 0-category (or (0,0)-category) is, up to equivalence, the same as a set (or class).

> Remark 1.2. Interpreted literally, 0-category or (0,0)-category would be an ∞-category such that every j-cell for j>0 is an equivalence, and any two such j-cells that are parallel are equivalent. The picture that apparently emerges from this description might suggest a set equipped with an equivalence relation, or a what is sometimes called a setoid, or something even more complicated than that. One could thus say that a 0-category is a “setoid”, when considered just up to isomorphism. But it is more appropriate in higher category theory to consider these things up to equivalence rather than up to isomorphism [seems important!] when we do this, a 0-category is equivalent to a set again.

[what's the deal with canonical](https://twitter.com/EscardoMartin/status/1474460119735971840).

> Nonetheless, "unique up to unique isomorphism" is not a very useful notion. It just means the structure specified is unique up to isomorphism and has no non-trivial automorphism (in other words an isomorphism X→X has to be the identity homomorphism); if X had a non-trivial automorphism, then that automorphism would defeat the requirement of a unique isomorphism. Many properties used to specify structures up to isomorphism say nothing about the existence of automorphisms, so they will usually not specify anything up to unique isomorphism. What is very useful however is specifying something up to canonical automorphism: if X and Y are structures satisfying the specification, then there is an isomorphism X→Y, and in case there should be more than one such isomorphism, there is a way to single out one of them by a special property. In practice this special property is usually directly related to the specification that X,Y have to satisfy, and the existence of a canonical isomorphism an immediate consequence of it.

>  equivalence between two categories is a pair of functors between them which are inverse to each other up to natural isomorphism of functors (inverse functors).

> This is like an isomorphism, but weakened  [seems important!] such as to accomodate for the fact that the correct ambient context for categories is not iself a 1-category, but is the 2-category Cat of all categories. Hence abstractly an equivalence of categories is just the special case of an equivalence in a 2-category specialized to Cat.

> We discuss some possible variants of the definition of equivalence of categories, each of which comes naturally from a different view of Cat.

> The first, isomorphism, comes from viewing Cat as a mere 1-category; it is too strong and is really only of interest for strict categories. The next, strong equivalence, comes from viewing Cat as a strict 2-category; it is the most common definition given and is correct if and only if the axiom of choice holds. The next definition, weak equivalence, comes from viewing Cat as a model category; it is correct with or without choice and is about as simple to define as strong equivalence. The last, anaequivalence, comes from viewing Cat as a bicategory that is not (without the axiom of choice) equivalent (as a bicategory!) to the strict 2-category that defines strong equivalence; it is also always correct.

> A rather different application, of which monoidal categories can be considered an abstraction, is that of a system of data types closed under a type constructor that takes two types and builds an aggregate type; the types are the objects and {\displaystyle \otimes }\otimes  is the aggregate constructor. The associativity up to isomorphism is then a way of expressing that different ways of aggregating the same data—such as {\displaystyle ((a,b),c)}{\displaystyle ((a,b),c)} and {\displaystyle (a,(b,c))}{\displaystyle (a,(b,c))}—store the same information even though the aggregate values need not be the same. Identity objects are analogous to algebraic operations addition (type sum) and multiplication (type product). For type product - identity object is the unit {\displaystyle ()}(), it trivially fully inhabits its type, so there is only one inhabitant of the type, and that is why a product with it is always isomorphic to the other operand. For type sum, the identity object is the void type, which stores no information and its inhabitants impossible to address. The concept of monoidal category does not presume that values of such aggregate types can be taken apart; on the contrary, it provides a framework that unifies classical and quantum information theory.[1]

> Unfortunately, we’re not quite done with revising our definition yet. We’ll be taking our tensor products and identity objects and stringing them together to make new functors, and similarly we’ll be using these natural isomorphisms to relate these functors, but we need to make sure that the relationship doesn’t depend on how we build it from the basic natural isomorphisms. An example should help make this clearer.

> What’s happened is we’ve replaced equations at the level of sets with (natural) isomorphisms at the level of the category, but these isomorphisms are now subject to new equations. We’ve seen two examples of these new equations, and it turns out that all the others follow from these two. I’ll defer the justification of this “coherence theorem” until later.

> Open a standard book on category theory, and consider a typical categorical definition. It usually
reads: “Mumble, such that the following diagram commutes.” Similarly, a typical categorical
result states: “If diagram1 and ... and diagramn commute, then diagram commutes.” The first
step in understanding such statements is to determine exactly their universality: what is exactly
quantified, universally or existentially, what depends on what, what are exactly the parameters of
the (frequent) unicity condition. The next step is to realize that the diagram states conditional
equalities on arrows, and that it is enough to state the equalities of the inside diagrams in order to
get all equalities
