> Stage 1 does not support interactive execution (GHCi) and Template Haskell. The reason being that when running byte code we must dynamically link the packages, and only in stage 2 and later can we guarantee that the packages we dynamically link are compatible with those that GHC was built against (because they are the very same packages).

[Contributing to GHC 2: Basic Hacking and Organization](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2018/6/18/contributing-to-ghc-2-basic-hacking-and-organization)

> So why did we need to build the compiler twice, wouldn’t the stage 1 compiler and the stage 1 package database have been enough? That’s a good question! We need to build the stage 2 compiler with the stage 1 compiler using the stage 1 package database (the one we will ship with the stage 2 compiler). As such, the compiler is built with the identical libraries that it ships with. When running / interpreting byte code, we need to dynamically link packages and this way we can guarantee that the packages we link are identical to the ones the compiler was built with. This it is also the reason why we don’t have GHCi or Template Haskell support in the stage 1 compiler.

> In GHC, scopes are represented by VarSets. These VarSets
are implemented by finite maps from uniques to Vars. Querying whether a variable is contained within this set is done
by checking whether the unique of the variable is in the
domain of the map. However, that query doesn’t ensure
that the same variable is stored in the set, only one with
the same unique. Thus, we require a stronger property: not
only should the variable stored in the set have the same
unique, but it should also be the “same” variable in the sense
of almostEqual, shown below. In that way, all of the occurrences of that variable in the expression will be forced to
have the same meta-information

> The obvious point to connect to GHC codegen is STG, because Core is too restricted by its specific (and weak) type system, and Cmm is too low-level to be convenient. For example, Agda can compile to Haskell, but because the Haskell type system is weak in comparison, the code output is a horrid mess where almost everything is wrapped in unsafeCoerce, and this can be very poorly optimized by GHC. STG in contrast has a type system which only represents memory layouts and basic operational features, so it's a lot more flexible.

Essential reading! Covers: 

- the importance of demand analysis
- the assymmetry between laziness in arguments vs. laziness in results which is exacerbated by the "open world" of separate compilation
- how exporting vs not exporting a function might influence optimizations, because of the above.
- the importance of using strictness annotations for forbidding unusual, nonsensical usage patterns that harm optimization.

> You might start by looking at what has been allocated: which types of closures and which constructors are contributing significantly to the problem. Then perhaps it’s prudent to look at why a closure has been allocated by the info table provenance information. This will tell you from which point in the source code your allocations are coming from. But if if you then turned to investigate when a closure was allocated during the lifecycle of your program, you end up being stuck.

> Adding Core definitions to interface files makes it possible to defer the choice of backend (between no code, static object code, dynamic object code, bytecode) until more is known about the necessary targets. In particular:

> Cabal pessimises build times by building both static and dynamic objects under the assumption that you will eventually need dynamic objects to run Template Haskell splices. With the Core definitions at hand, we can delay this choice until we know for sure we need to do the work.

> Linking many large object files, which happens once per splice, can be very expensive compared to linking bytecode.
