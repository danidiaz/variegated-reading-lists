[Practical Coinduction](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/papers/Structural.pdf) A property holds by induction if there is good reason for it to hold; whereas a property holds by coinduction if there is no good reason for it not to hold.

[Proof by Coinduction](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/09/proof_by_coinduction.html)  coinduction is going to rely on the fact that epimorphisms from terminal coalgebras are isomorphisms, i.e., there’s no quotient coalgebra of a terminal coalgebra.

> Something you may want to look at is Cedille/CDLE, which is (for the most part) CoC extended with dependent intersection types, implicit products, and a heterogeneous equality type. In it, you can get dependent eliminators, including induction. You can also prove parametricity and a few other interesting things.

> The theory is barely more complicated than the CoC, it doesn't require termination or positivity checking, doesn't require an implementation of unification, etc.

> Suffice to day that Ehrhard and Regnier discovered something quite profound in differential lambda calculus, the implications of which are still being explored; this discovery should have significant bearing on what people refer to as differentiable programming, I think.

> The third link above is the master’s thesis of my talented student James Clift. We have subsequently extended that work and are finishing a paper which explains the computational content of derivatives of Turing machines, according to differential linear logic. This might be of interest to people here. I will post a link when we put it online.

> Pearlmutter and Siskind's basic idea is to use Reynolds defunctionalization transformation to turn higher-order programs into first-order programs, and then apply automatic differentiation to the resulting first-order program.
