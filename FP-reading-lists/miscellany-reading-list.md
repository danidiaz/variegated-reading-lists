[template haskell quotes](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XTemplateHaskellQuotes)

> A typed expression quotation is written as [|| ... ||], or [e|| ... ||], where the ”...” is an expression; if the ”...” expression has type a, then the quotation has type Q (TExp a).

> Values of type TExp a may be converted to values of type Exp using the function unType :: TExp a -> Exp.

> Top-level declaration splices break up a source file into declaration groups. A declaration group is the group of declarations created by a top-level declaration splice, plus those following it, down to but not including the next top-level declaration splice. N.B. only top-level splices delimit declaration groups, not expression splices. The first declaration group in a module includes all top-level definitions down to but not including the first top-level declaration splice.

> A typed expression splice is written $$x, where x is an identifier, or $$(...), where the ”...” is an arbitrary expression.

> A typed expression splice can occur in place of an expression; the spliced expression must have type Q (TExp a)

> A typed expression quotation is written as [|| ... ||], or [e|| ... ||], where the ”...” is an expression; if the ”...” expression has type a, then the quotation has type Q (TExp a).

> Values of type TExp a may be converted to values of type Exp using the function unType :: TExp a -> Exp.

> The problem with typed TH splice is that it doesn’t really make sense at the top-level and it should be treated as an implicit splice.

> It could also be that the use of SAT solvers is entirely spurious, driven by the availability of technology, rather than by an intrinsic need. Maybe the problems that need to be solved for verification purposes _can_ be reduced to SAT, but it does not mean that they _have to be_ reduced to SAT. The solvers may “work” exactly because they’re asked to solve problems that admit polynomial-time solutions, given a bit more ingenuity and effort. In fact, the claim that “practical instances” are easily solvable can be taken as evidence that the problems to be solved are not really SAT problems after all (ie, they don’t cover the space of SAT problems).

> One important takeaway is that dynamic programming in the Bellman formulation is a discrete analogue of Hamilton-Jacobi theory in how it writes down an equation for the optimal value as a function of a given endpoint rather than writing down an equation for the path as with the Euler-Lagrange equations. (You can reconstruct the path from the value function after the fact by gradient descent.) The relationship between Hamilton-Jacobi and Euler-Lagrange is the classical version of wave-particle duality. A concrete example in geometrical optics is the eikonal equation, a Hamilton-Jacobi type PDE, versus the geodesic equation, an Euler-Lagrange type ODE. Not coincidentally, one common numerical method for the eikonal equation called the fast marching method is a dynamic programming algorithm, very similar to Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths.

> It should be mentioned that any "local" equation like a PDE or ODE cannot describe a globally optimal solution without strong assumptions such as convexity. In fact, satisfying the Euler-Lagrange equation isn't even sufficient for local optimality without further qualifications (Weierstrass conditions). But the Bellman dynamic programming equation, being recursive, can describe globally optimal solutions.

> I strongly disagree with you. I think too few people use exceptions. They're great for making code more expressive, and it's only through exceptions that you can avoid two-phase initialization of classes and make constructors actually useful. It's only through exceptions that you can have meaningful copy-constructable resource-holding value types. Avoiding these constructs severely restricts the language. And for what? The arguments against exceptions appear to mostly arise from misunderstanding or some kind of weird aesthetic sense that I don't have.

> Error codes also generally discard context and encourage a "just abort" mentality, especially with respect to memory exhaustion. That, or they become so general, mechanized, and macro-ized that they might as well be exceptions, but worse in almost every way.

[evidence-passing effect handlers](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/the-issues-with-effect-systems/5630/19)

> What is evidence-passing? It basically means to pass the effect handlers around in the Eff monad, so instead of handlers traversing a big program tree like in free monads, we directly call the handlers in place. This is a much more performant approach, and it’s pretty shocking that nobody thought of this before. Nowadays, eff, eveff, mpeff, speff, cleff, and effectful all use evidence passing.

> Delimited continuations are nothing new actually, and has been used to develop other languages with effects like Koka since at least 2015. Probably nobody thought of doing this in Haskell before because Haskell didn’t support it natively, and they didn’t think it would be efficient. Ningning came up with a monad that can do delimited continuations fairly fast, which is used in eveff, mpeff and speff.

> Future effect system users will probably face a choice between nondeterminism-capable libraries and MonadUnliftIO-capable libraries and they will need to choose based on their specific needs.

> You can compile first-class functions via closure conversion or defunctionalization. I used to look down on the latter, since it’s a whole-program transform. But, secretly, so is closure conversion: it needs a relocating linker!

> In closure conversion, a lambda becomes a ‘closure’ containing a function pointer and closed-over variables.

> In defunctionalization, each lambda creates a branch of a datatype, with arguments for closed-over variables, and a global ‘apply’ function case-analyses this type.

[typed closure conversion](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/closures/popl96.pdf). [Typed Closure Conversion for the Calculus of Constructions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04006.pdf). [Type Systems for Closure Conversions](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/tba/papers/hannan-tpa95.pdf). [Closure Conversion as CoYoneda](https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/blog/2017/08/28/closure-conversion-as-coyoneda/). [closure conversion slides](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/teaching/archive/advanced_compiler/2007/resources/slides/act-2007-05-closure-conversion.pdf)

> Closure conversion  is a program transformation that achieves a separation between code and data. Functions with free variables are replaced by code abstracted on an extra environment parameter. Free variables in the body of the function are replaced by references to the environment. The abstracted code is \partially applied" to an explicitly constructed environment providing the bindings for these variables. This \partial application" of the code to its environment is in fact suspended until the function is actually applied to its argument; the suspended application is called a \closure", a data structure containing pure code and a representation of its environment.  A critical decision in closure conversion is the choice of representation of the environment as a data structure | for example, whether to use a ", \linked", or hybrid representation.

> C functions cannot be nested: they must all appear at the top level. This severely restricts their usefulness, but greatly simplifies their implementation – they can be represented as simple code pointers.

> Closure conversion transforms a program in which functions can be nested and have free variables into an equivalent one containing only top-level – and hence closed – functions

> The output of closure conversion is therefore a program in which functions can be represented as code pointers!

> The free variables of a function are the variables that are used but not defined in that function – i.e. they are defined in some enclosing scope.

[Closure conversion: How to compile lambda](https://matt.might.net/articles/closure-conversion/)

> Syntactically, lambda refers to a form for describing anonymous functions.

> But, a lambda does not become a function pointer.

> It becomes a closure.

> Closures are data structures with both a code and a data component.
