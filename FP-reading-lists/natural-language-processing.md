MONTAGUE GRAMMAR, CATEGORIES AND TYPES: A PRESENTATION OF ACTUAL THEORIES IN SEMANTICS AND DISCOURSE INTERPRETATION

> DBS was designed to answer the central theoretical question for building a talking robot

> Given the opportunity to use the computers at CSLI Stanford (1984-86), we attempted to computationally verify the SCG fragment of English with an implementation in Lisp. This seemed possible for the following reasons

> Montague Grammar has inspired several generations of formal semanticists. It
has paved the way to a precise formulation of semantic problems and solutions.
Montague has shown that it is possible to do highly rigorous work and yet make
substantial progress at the same time. What it certainly is not, however, is the
last word on matters. Especially when it comes to compositionality there is no
consensus whether Montague has supplied a fully compositional approach. This
has nothing to do with a lack of precision; it has more to do with the question
whether the abstract formulation is a good rendering of our initial intuitions. In
many ways, Montague looks more like a technician than a theoretician; he prefers
something that works over something that has intrinsic virtues. Forty years on, the
ideas have been substantially modified. We seem to have a much more profound
notion of what is a compositional semantics.

> But, despite of the importance of the role played by the logical grammars
in the “semantic controversies” during the decade 1955-1965, they
didn’t influence substantially in the later developments, fundamentally in
those that were carried out in the generative frame. It is in this sense in
which it is necessary to interpret Gerald Gazdar’s and Geoffrey Pullum’s
following statement:

> “Categorial grammars [...] have always had a somewhat marginal status in linguistics.
There has always been someone ready to champion them, but never enough people
actually using them to turn them into a paradigm. The currency they have [...] is due in
large measure to Montague, who based his semantic work on a modified categorial
grammar”

> In Stockholm, when I first discussed the project with Per Martin-Löf, he said that he had designed type theory for mathematics, and than natural language is something else. I said that similar work had been done within predicate calculus, which is just a part of type theory, to which he replied that he found it equally problematic. But his general attitude was far from discouraging: it was more that he was so serious about natural language and saw the problems of my enterprise more clearly than I, who had already assumed the point of view of logical semantics. His criticism was penetrating but patient, and he was generous in telling me about his own ideas. So we gradually developed a view that satisfied both of us, that formal grammar begins with what is well understood formally, and then tries to see how this formal structure is manifested in natural language, instead of starting with natural language in all it unlimitedness and trying to force it into some given formalism.
