> Type theories are not set theories — they do not have a separate logical formula language, like that of Frege, to serve as a basis for the theory. So, one cannot achieve consistency in type theory by restricting how a set may be constructed from a logical formula. Instead, type theory places restrictions on the kinds of formulae that can be expressed. Rather that rule out paradoxical sets representing self-referential propositions, type theory rules out the propositions themselves. In such a theory, it is not even well-formed to ask if a set contains itself4.

> To account for higher-order concepts, rather than admit higher-order judgments, we usually internalize judgmental notions as types: dependent sums internalize context extension, dependent products internalize entailment, and propositional equality should in some sense internalize judgmental equality

> we eliminate definitional equality and replace all computation rules by propositional equalities

> “My personal disenchantment with dependent type theories
coincides with the decision to shift from extensional to intensional equality. This meant for example
that 0 + n = n and n + 0 = n would henceforth be regarded as fundamentally different assertions,
one an identity holding by definition and the other a mere equality proved by induction. Of course I
was personally upset to see several years of work, along with Constable’s Nuprl project, suddenly put
beyond the pale. But I also had the feeling that this decision had been imposed on the community
rather than arising from rational discussion. And I see the entire homotopy type theory effort as an
attempt to make equality reasonable again.”

> Because of Goedel's Incompleteness Theorems, we know that we cannot describe a complete axiomatization of mathematics. Any proposed axiomatization T, if consistent, will be unable to prove the principle Con(T) asserting that T itself is consistent, although we have reason to desire this principle once we have committed ourselves to T. Adding the consistency principle Con(T) simply puts off the question to Con(T+Con(T)), and so on, in a process that proceeds into the transfinite.

> Thus, the large cardinal hierarchy provides exactly the tower of theories, whose levels transcend consistency strength, that we knew should exist. And it does so in a way that is mathematically robust and interesting, with its foundations arising, not in some syntactic diagonalization, but in mathematically fulfilling and meaningful questions in infinite combinatorics.

> In a striking turn of events, soon thereafter, Kunen proved that Reinhardt cardinals are inconsistent with ZFC! Since then, we have been edging closer and closer to this chasm of inconsistency, defining stronger and stronger large cardinal axioms that stop just short of falling prey to Kunen’s proof.

> And then you have the "Jack-in-the-box" axioms - that just give you a set ex nihilo, that you otherwise couldn't build using the toolbox. In ZFC, there's only one - Infinity. But we often consider other similar axioms - we call them "strong axioms of infinity," or large cardinals.

> The reason Infinity has to be a jack-in-the-box is that, if we start with the emptyset, then all our toolbox axioms just keep spitting out finite sets. So we have a "gap" between the finite and the infinite.

> We do know that ZFC cannot prove that there is even one inaccessible cardinal. And we know we cannot prove in ZFC that the existence of an inaccessible is consistent, because of limitations coming from the incompleteness theorems. So any argument that inaccessibles are consistent will have to use methods that cannot be formalized in ZFC.

> There is a rough convention that results provable from ZFC alone may be stated without hypotheses, but that if the proof requires other assumptions (such as the existence of large cardinals), these should be stated. Whether this is simply a linguistic convention, or something more, is a controversial point among distinct philosophical schools (see Motivations and epistemic status below).

>  type theory isn't an alternative to set theory, it's an alternative to first-order logic (FOL). A type theory is another kind of logic; it's not a theory within first-order logic like set theory. In other words, type theory (as a foundation) is a logical basis for mathematical constructions while set theory could be called, for lack of a better word1, a "mathematical" basis for mathematical constructions. 

> Type theory, though, wasn't meant to be used like FOL. FOL is like a specification language. A first-order theory is like a specification, and we're primarily interested in models of the theory, i.e. things that fit the specification.

> The ability to give a name to some arbitrary element of a nonempty set is known as "existential instantiation". This is an inference rule of the underlying logic, not part of the theory, and so it is included not only in ZFC, but also in ZF, and in appropriate forms it is also included in PA and every other first-order theory.

> Making one choice is simple, if a set A is not empty, then ∃a(a∈A), and therefore we can pick such a. This is called existential instantiation. But this choice is completely arbitrary. 

> However making infinitely many arbitrary choices is something we cannot prove to be possible1. 

> Remember that arbitrary sets have absolutely no structure. We only have ∈ in our language, and we have sets and their elements. Sometimes we are lucky and the elements of the set are nice enough to allow for a definable way of choosing from them. For example if the empty set is a member or something.

> A common misconception is that countable choice has an inductive nature and is therefore provable as a theorem (in ZF, or similar, or even weaker systems) by induction. However, this is not the case; this misconception is the result of confusing countable choice with finite choice for a finite set of size n (for arbitrary n), and it is this latter result (which is an elementary theorem in combinatorics) that is provable by induction.

> One could view the axiom of choice as a sort of finitary (and therefore usable) surrogate for the infinitely long axioms and proofs that would come up in your approach.

> If all the sets you choose from are the same, then constant choices are choices that you can always make. If all the sets you choose from have a particular structure on all of them (e.g. they are all finite sets of real numbers), then you can choose from them all (e.g. they are all finite sets of real numbers, take the minimal element).

> We develop a series of small infinitary epistemic logics to study deductive inference involving
intra/inter-personal beliefs/knowledge in social situations. In these situations, people’s beliefs
may include infinitary components such as common knowledge, common beliefs, and infinite
regress of beliefs.
