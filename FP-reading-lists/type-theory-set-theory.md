> Type theories are not set theories — they do not have a separate logical formula language, like that of Frege, to serve as a basis for the theory. So, one cannot achieve consistency in type theory by restricting how a set may be constructed from a logical formula. Instead, type theory places restrictions on the kinds of formulae that can be expressed. Rather that rule out paradoxical sets representing self-referential propositions, type theory rules out the propositions themselves. In such a theory, it is not even well-formed to ask if a set contains itself4.

> The collection of automated equations in a given type theory is called definitional equality; the more equations are definitional, the less time users must spend providing coercions.
 
> To account for higher-order concepts, rather than admit higher-order judgments, we usually internalize judgmental notions as types: dependent sums internalize context extension, dependent products internalize entailment, and propositional equality should in some sense internalize judgmental equality

> we eliminate definitional equality and replace all computation rules by propositional equalities

> “My personal disenchantment with dependent type theories
coincides with the decision to shift from extensional to intensional equality. This meant for example
that 0 + n = n and n + 0 = n would henceforth be regarded as fundamentally different assertions,
one an identity holding by definition and the other a mere equality proved by induction. Of course I
was personally upset to see several years of work, along with Constable’s Nuprl project, suddenly put
beyond the pale. But I also had the feeling that this decision had been imposed on the community
rather than arising from rational discussion. And I see the entire homotopy type theory effort as an
attempt to make equality reasonable again.”

> Because of Goedel's Incompleteness Theorems, we know that we cannot describe a complete axiomatization of mathematics. Any proposed axiomatization T, if consistent, will be unable to prove the principle Con(T) asserting that T itself is consistent, although we have reason to desire this principle once we have committed ourselves to T. Adding the consistency principle Con(T) simply puts off the question to Con(T+Con(T)), and so on, in a process that proceeds into the transfinite.

> Thus, the large cardinal hierarchy provides exactly the tower of theories, whose levels transcend consistency strength, that we knew should exist.

Since then, we have been edging closer and closer to this chasm of inconsistency, defining stronger and stronger large cardinal axioms that stop just short of falling prey to Kunen’s proof.

> And then you have the "Jack-in-the-box" axioms - that just give you a set ex nihilo, that you otherwise couldn't build using the toolbox. In ZFC, there's only one - Infinity. But we often consider other similar axioms - we call them "strong axioms of infinity," or large cardinals.

> The reason Infinity has to be a jack-in-the-box is that, if we start with the emptyset, then all our toolbox axioms just keep spitting out finite sets. So we have a "gap" between the finite and the infinite.

> We do know that ZFC cannot prove that there is even one inaccessible cardinal. And we know we cannot prove in ZFC that the existence of an inaccessible is consistent, because of limitations coming from the incompleteness theorems. So any argument that inaccessibles are consistent will have to use methods that cannot be formalized in ZFC.

> There is a rough convention that results provable from ZFC alone may be stated without hypotheses, but that if the proof requires other assumptions (such as the existence of large cardinals), these should be stated. Whether this is simply a linguistic convention, or something more, is a controversial point among distinct philosophical schools (see Motivations and epistemic status below).

[Why did mathematicians choose ZFC set theory over Russell's type theory?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2130269/why-did-mathematicians-choose-zfc-set-theory-over-russells-type-theory).

>  type theory isn't an alternative to set theory, it's an alternative to first-order logic (FOL). A type theory is another kind of logic; it's not a theory within first-order logic like set theory. In other words, type theory (as a foundation) is a logical basis for mathematical constructions while set theory could be called, for lack of a better word1, a "mathematical" basis for mathematical constructions. 

> Type theory, though, wasn't meant to be used like FOL. FOL is like a specification language. A first-order theory is like a specification, and we're primarily interested in models of the theory, i.e. things that fit the specification.

[Why is the Axiom of Choice not needed when the collection of sets is finite?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2167783/why-is-the-axiom-of-choice-not-needed-when-the-collection-of-sets-is-finite/2167798).

[Axiom of Choice and finite sets](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/132717/axiom-of-choice-and-finite-sets).

> The ability to give a name to some arbitrary element of a nonempty set is known as "existential instantiation". This is an inference rule of the underlying logic, not part of the theory, and so it is included not only in ZFC, but also in ZF, and in appropriate forms it is also included in PA and every other first-order theory.

> Making one choice is simple, if a set A is not empty, then ∃a(a∈A), and therefore we can pick such a. This is called existential instantiation. But this choice is completely arbitrary. 

> However making infinitely many arbitrary choices is something we cannot prove to be possible1. 

> Remember that arbitrary sets have absolutely no structure. We only have ∈ in our language, and we have sets and their elements. Sometimes we are lucky and the elements of the set are nice enough to allow for a definable way of choosing from them. For example if the empty set is a member or something.

> A common misconception is that countable choice has an inductive nature and is therefore provable as a theorem (in ZF, or similar, or even weaker systems) by induction. However, this is not the case; this misconception is the result of confusing countable choice with finite choice for a finite set of size n (for arbitrary n), and it is this latter result (which is an elementary theorem in combinatorics) that is provable by induction. 

> The axiom of choice is a generalization of finiteness. It's related (by, for instance, the compactness theorem in logic, and Tychonoff's theorem in topology) to topological compactness, which is another generalization of finiteness.

> Without the axiom of choice, you can sometimes specify a choice: "Pick the left shoe from each pair." If you can make (read: define) such a specification, you don't need the axiom of choice, because you can point to that specification as your choice.

> In an informal sense, the axiom of choice says you can always take an infinite number of (certain kinds of) steps in finite time. (?)

> But the first ellipsis doesn't actually make sense in logic. No mathematical logic rules allow an infinite number of quantifiers. The axiom of choice sort of says, "That's okay, it still works." 

> On the other hand, you can define the "left shoe" choice with only a finite number of quantifiers.

> we can see the pairing axiom (which asserts that (x,y,z) is a set) doing the work of compressing n existence quantifiers into one.

> I want to make it clear that there is no actual choosing going on here. It is

> might be "indistinguishable socks" for all we care. It doesn't matter,
> because *the ambiguity of the original choices has been off-loaded to

> The problem with this method is that pairing only works for n=2, or by

> If all the sets you choose from are the same, then constant choices are choices that you can always make. If all the sets you choose from have a particular structure on all of them (e.g. they are all finite sets of real numbers), then you can choose from them all (e.g. they are all finite sets of real numbers, take the minimal element).

[Finite axiom of choice: how do you prove it from just ZF?](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/32538/finite-axiom-of-choice-how-do-you-prove-it-from-just-zf)

> when dealing with a finite number of sets you can explicitly write the function in the form of a formula. However, in the infinite case you cannot write this sort of formula (it would require infinitely many quantifiers to mention which element is chosen) and therefore you're in need of a stronger tool that would guarantee the existence of such function

> If we can't explicitly define any particular y, then we won't be able to define any particular choice function either, but the problem doesn't require us to explicitly define a choice function

[Do We Need the Axiom of Choice for Finite Sets?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/132717/do-we-need-the-axiom-of-choice-for-finite-sets)

> The matter of the axiom of choice is not to choose among an infinite set, but make an infinity of choice.

> The ability to give a name to some arbitrary element of a nonempty set is known as "existential instantiation". This is an inference rule of the underlying logic, not part of the theory, and so it is included not only in ZFC, but also in ZF, and in appropriate forms it is also included in PA and every other first-order theory. 

> The intuition is that giving a name to an object does not really require "choosing" an object; if we know that there is an element in a set A, and we begin arguing about some "given" element c∈A, we do not have to actually make a choice, we can just reason hypothetically ("what if we knew an element c of A?")

> This reasoning will be sound because A really is nonempty. However, because we don't know which element is chosen, the only properties we know it has are the ones we can prove every element of A has. In particular, we cannot assume that the element we are given is equal to any other object we already have, unless we can prove they are equal. So we need to give a new name that we are not already using for any other object.

> You might be thinking that "choosing" a single element from a set would be an algorithmic operation, but this is just not the case. The nonconstructivity of existential instantiation is a direct consequence of the nonconstructive meaning of ∃ in classical logic. To get a system where you can effectively choose a witness to any true existential statement, you have to move to constructive mathematics, but then the meaning of ∃ changes as well.

> Saying S is not empty, therefore there is an x∈S, does not suffice.

> Ah, but it does suffice! 

> The axiom of choice, as said, allows us to choose from infinitely many sets at once (sometimes even when these sets are finite!). If, however, one only wishes to choose from finitely many sets then this can be done without it. It does not even matter if the sets themselves are finite or not.

[Why is the axiom of choice required for infinite, but not finite, sets?](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-axiom-of-choice-required-for-infinite-but-not-finite-sets)

> The axiom of choice is still required to prove that a choice function exists for an infinite family of finite sets. That a choice function exists for a finite family of sets (of whatever size) can be proven in ZF without the axiom of choice.

> For a finite family  R , the axiom of choice is not required, because we can prove by induction that a choice function exists. 

[Why is the Axiom of Choice not needed when the collection of sets is finite?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2167783/why-is-the-axiom-of-choice-not-needed-when-the-collection-of-sets-is-finite)

> The English mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell gave the following succinct example of this distinction: “To choose one sock from each of infinitely many pairs of socks requires the Axiom of Choice, but for shoes the Axiom is not needed.”

> Bertrand Russell summed it up neatly: "To choose one sock from each of infinitely many pairs of socks requires the Axiom of Choice, but for shoes the Axiom is not needed. His point is that the two socks in a pair are identical in appearance, so, to pick one of them, we have to make an arbitrary choice. For shoes, we can use an explicit rule, such as "always choose the left shoe." Russell specifically mentions infinitely many pairs, because if the number is finite then AC is superfluous: we can pick one member of each pair using the definition of "nonempty" and then repeat the operation finitely many times using the rules of formal logic.

[Does the axiom of choice have any use for finite sets?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1657972/does-the-axiom-of-choice-have-any-use-for-finite-sets)

> Even for (infinite setts of) pairs the axiom of choice is does not follow from ZF if one looks at an infinite collection.

>  If you mean that the family of sets itself is finite, then AC can be proved in ZF by induction, i.e., it is automatic, but this is only true if your background logic is classical. For intuitionistic logic, the axiom of choice can be very powerful even for finite sets. For example, there is a theorem that the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle; in this sense the introduction of AC "defeats" the intuitionistic logic and turns the situation into a classical one.
