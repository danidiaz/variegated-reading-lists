> Type theories are not set theories — they do not have a separate logical formula language, like that of Frege, to serve as a basis for the theory. So, one cannot achieve consistency in type theory by restricting how a set may be constructed from a logical formula. Instead, type theory places restrictions on the kinds of formulae that can be expressed. Rather that rule out paradoxical sets representing self-referential propositions, type theory rules out the propositions themselves. In such a theory, it is not even well-formed to ask if a set contains itself4.

> The collection of automated equations in a given type theory is called definitional equality; the more equations are definitional, the less time users must spend providing coercions.
 
> To account for higher-order concepts, rather than admit higher-order judgments, we usually internalize judgmental notions as types: dependent sums internalize context extension, dependent products internalize entailment, and propositional equality should in some sense internalize judgmental equality

> we eliminate definitional equality and replace all computation rules by propositional equalities

> “My personal disenchantment with dependent type theories
coincides with the decision to shift from extensional to intensional equality. This meant for example
that 0 + n = n and n + 0 = n would henceforth be regarded as fundamentally different assertions,
one an identity holding by definition and the other a mere equality proved by induction. Of course I
was personally upset to see several years of work, along with Constable’s Nuprl project, suddenly put
beyond the pale. But I also had the feeling that this decision had been imposed on the community
rather than arising from rational discussion. And I see the entire homotopy type theory effort as an
attempt to make equality reasonable again.”

> Abstract: The raw syntax of a type theory, or more generally of a formal system with binding constructs, involves not only free and bound variables, but also meta-variables, which feature in inference rules. Each notion of variable has an associated notion of substitution. A syntactic translation from one type theory to another brings in one more level of substitutions, this time mapping type-theoretic constructors to terms. Working with three levels of substitution, each depending on the previous one, is cumbersome and repetitive. One gets the feeling that there should be a better way to deal with syntax.

> Instead, we can think about them as follows. The original CoC with impredicative Set allows the definition of inductive types, but was insufficient to prove all of their desired properties; hence first-class inductive types were introduced (and can also be added to a predicative theory). With HITs, we notice a somewhat more general class of definitions that we can make in CiC with impredicative Set (after adding first-class inductive types to CoC), but which again have desired properties that are not provable there (and are also predicative); hence we again need to make them first-class objects.

[categorical model of dependent types](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/categorical+model+of+dependent+types#categories_with_families)

> The way this is generally dealt with is to introduce a category-theoretic structure which does have a “substitution” operation which is strictly associative, hence does correspond directly to type theory, and then show that any category can be “strictified” into such a stricter structure. Unfortunately, there are many different such structures which have been used, differing only slightly.

> The trouble on this side is that working with higher-order logical structure in contextual categories quickly becomes unreadable. The reader preferring to take contextual categories as primary may regard the syntax as essentially a notation for working within them: a powerful, flexible, and intuitive notation, but one whose validity requires non-trivial work to establish. (The situation is comparable to that of string diagrams, as used in monoidal and more elaborately structured categories.)

> In most set theories, W-types can be proven to exist, but in predicative mathematics or type theory, where this is not the case, they are often assumed explicitly to exist. In particular, W-types can be used to provide a constructive counterpart of the classical notion of a well-ordering and to uniformly define a variety of inductive types. More complex inductive types, with multiple constructors that are assumed only to be strictly positive, can be reduced to W-types, at least in the presence of other structure such as sum types and function extensionality; see for instance AAG. This can even be extended to inductive families.

> Most people know that the first step to using Coq effectively is to avoid dependent types as much as possible and treat it like HOL. (This has more to do with the downsides of Coq's particular version of dependent type theory than with dependent type theory itself.)

> The informal/everyday mathematical vernacular has much more in common with dependent type theory than with HOL-style formalization. Aside from dependency in general (which appears all the time in ordinary mathematics, but can always be rewritten to avoid dependency), one of the big differences from HOL-style formalization is that in informal mathematical vernacular, there are no types: there are just sets, but these sets behave like a dependent type theory (it is unfortunate that the terminology of "types" is likely to lead to a lot of talk across purposes) — so someone who wishes to work with the sets of everyday mathematical vernacular may find dependent type theory to be a more natural way to do this than other formalizations of the idea of a set, e.g. those of HOL which add a new and unfamiliar layer of simple types that doesn't occur in the informal vernacular.

> Many people are trying to work constructively, for a variety of reasons; some want to work constructively for what I perceive to be silly ideological reasons, and others want to work constructively because we are actually making use of the generality of constructive mathematics as a way to give much simpler proofs of classical results. For instance, if you prove some basic theorems of commutative algebra constructively, you can instantiate them in a certain topos and obtain much more sophisticated results of algebraic geometry for free — e.g. safely passing from ordinary modules to sheaves of modules, etc. This is the way that I use constructive mathematics. Anyway, this has absolutely nothing at all to do with dependent type theory, but the only mature tools that allow you to work constructively are dependent-type theoretic. If there were a version of Isabelle/IHOL with infrastructure and libraries as mature as those of Isabelle/HOL, many of us would be using it. But it remains unclear to me whether such a thing can exist, because many of the very wonderful aspects of the Isabelle/HOL approach to things really depend fundamentally on having a global choice operator. It becomes much harder to work in logic over simple types when you don't have global choice. You have to deal with partial operations much sooner and more explicitly than ever, and this is not easy.

> I don't for one moment subscribe to the view that one *needs* dependent types to do semantics. Moreover, I'm inclined to think that the use of dependent
types solely for logical *super*structure is a waste of dependent types

> I'm envious of the degree of automation that Isabelle affords: the fruit of
years of hard work. I'd like to see a similar effort in automation in the
proof machinery for dependently typed programming languages. I don't think
the type technology presents a barrier to automation: if anything, the extra
hygiene offered by precise types gives a cleaner substrate on which to build
the logical layer.

> I'm certainly not claiming that dependent types are *necessary*. The best I
can hope here is to have demonstrated by example that they can sometimes offer
a helpful degree of extra comfort.

evaluation is only concerned with computing closed expressions, normalization also
applies to function bodies, thus, needs to compute with open expressions containing
free variables. NbE reduces normalization to evaluation of expressions in a residualizing
model, i. e., a computational structure that has extra base values which are unknowns

> Benjamin Pierce often emphasizes the distinction between the two different ideas used in that paper: (1) local type inference and (2) bidirectional type inference. Local type inference refers to avoiding the use of 'global' constraint solving techniques like unification. Bidirectional typing, to him, is a particular way of dividing a type inference procedure up into a synthesizing part and a checking part. It works with both local and global approaches. I could be wrong about this, but I have heard GHC actually structures type inference in a bidirectional way while also using global HM-style equality constraints. Anyway, I think it has become fairly common to conflate (1) and (2) in casual conversation these days, so maybe the difference is seen by some as a technicality.

> The basic idea of bidirectional checking is well known as folklore. Similar ideas
have been used, for example, in ML compilers and typecheckers based on attribute
grammars. However, this technique has usually been combined with ML-style type
inference (see, for example, Aditya and Nikhil [1991]); it is surprisingly powerful
when used by itself as a local type inference method.

[What is bidirectional type checking?](https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/questions/1090/what-is-bidirectional-type-checking). [Bidirectional Typing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05839).

> Bidirectional typing combines two modes of typing: type checking, which checks that a program satisfies a known type, and type synthesis, which determines a type from the program. Using checking enables bidirectional typing to support features for which inference is undecidable; using synthesis enables bidirectional typing to avoid the large annotation burden of explicitly typed languages. In addition, bidirectional typing improves error locality. We highlight the design principles that underlie bidirectional type systems, survey the development of bidirectional typing from the prehistoric period before Pierce and Turner's local type inference to the present day, and provide guidance for future investigations.

> As far as I know, the word "ramified", in reference to type theory, means that one pays attention not only to the ranks of sets (where sets of rank n have members of rank n−1) but also to the complexity of their definitions. So for example, a set of fairly low rank, like a set of natural numbers, might be defined by a formula that quantifies over sets of high ranks and would be considered to have high "level". The comprehension axioms of such a type theory would impose limitations on both the ranks and the levels of the sets involved.

> What is predicativity? While the term suggests that there is a single idea
involved, what the history will show is that there are a number of ideas of
predicativity which may lead to different logical analyses, and I shall uncover
these only gradually. A central question will then be what, if anything, unifies
them. Though early discussions are often muddy on the concepts and their
employment, in a number of important respects they set the stage for the further
developments,

[A Survey of Predicativity](https://www.cs.ru.nl/R.Adams/predicativity3.pdf)

> A first such criterion was offered by Poincar´e in the third part of his paper Les
Math´ematiques et la Logique [Poi06]. He proposed the vicious circle principle:
“The definitions which ought to be regarded as non-predicative are those which
contain a vicious circle.”

> In general, the type theory community has confined its interest in predicativity
to the question of whether a universe is predicative.
Roughly, a universe U is a type of types. We say U is impredicative if some
of the types in U are constructed using U itself; for example, if Πx : U.x has
type U. Otherwise, U is predicative. A type theory is called predicative if it
contains no impredicative universes

> Later [ML82] Martin-L¨of extended the system again to include W-types,
types of well-ordered trees, and an infinite series of predicative universes V0, V1,
V2, . . . , with V0 ∈ V1 ∈ V2 ∈ · · · 

> The definition of W-types is not a simple inductive definition, but a generalised inductive definition. Including W-types increases the strength of a type theory dramatically. Setzer [Set93] has shown that even ML1W has a prooftheoretic ordinal that is much larger than Γ0. If we agree with Parsons that there are two senses of the word ’predicative’, then type theories with W-types are predicative in Lorenzen and Myhill’s sense, but not in Feferman and Sch¨utte’s sense

In our approach, optimizations take the form of equality analyses that add equality information to a common intermediate representation.

> Because of Goedel's Incompleteness Theorems, we know that we cannot describe a complete axiomatization of mathematics. Any proposed axiomatization T, if consistent, will be unable to prove the principle Con(T) asserting that T itself is consistent, although we have reason to desire this principle once we have committed ourselves to T. Adding the consistency principle Con(T) simply puts off the question to Con(T+Con(T)), and so on, in a process that proceeds into the transfinite.

> Thus, the large cardinal hierarchy provides exactly the tower of theories, whose levels transcend consistency strength, that we knew should exist. And it does so in a way that is mathematically robust and interesting, with its foundations arising, not in some syntactic diagonalization, but in mathematically fulfilling and meaningful questions in infinite combinatorics.

> In a striking turn of events, soon thereafter, Kunen proved that Reinhardt cardinals are inconsistent with ZFC! Since then, we have been edging closer and closer to this chasm of inconsistency, defining stronger and stronger large cardinal axioms that stop just short of falling prey to Kunen’s proof.

> And then you have the "Jack-in-the-box" axioms - that just give you a set ex nihilo, that you otherwise couldn't build using the toolbox. In ZFC, there's only one - Infinity. But we often consider other similar axioms - we call them "strong axioms of infinity," or large cardinals.

> The reason Infinity has to be a jack-in-the-box is that, if we start with the emptyset, then all our toolbox axioms just keep spitting out finite sets. So we have a "gap" between the finite and the infinite.

> We do know that ZFC cannot prove that there is even one inaccessible cardinal. And we know we cannot prove in ZFC that the existence of an inaccessible is consistent, because of limitations coming from the incompleteness theorems. So any argument that inaccessibles are consistent will have to use methods that cannot be formalized in ZFC.

> There is a rough convention that results provable from ZFC alone may be stated without hypotheses, but that if the proof requires other assumptions (such as the existence of large cardinals), these should be stated. Whether this is simply a linguistic convention, or something more, is a controversial point among distinct philosophical schools (see Motivations and epistemic status below).

>  type theory isn't an alternative to set theory, it's an alternative to first-order logic (FOL). A type theory is another kind of logic; it's not a theory within first-order logic like set theory. In other words, type theory (as a foundation) is a logical basis for mathematical constructions while set theory could be called, for lack of a better word1, a "mathematical" basis for mathematical constructions. 

> Type theory, though, wasn't meant to be used like FOL. FOL is like a specification language. A first-order theory is like a specification, and we're primarily interested in models of the theory, i.e. things that fit the specification.

[Why is the Axiom of Choice not needed when the collection of sets is finite?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2167783/why-is-the-axiom-of-choice-not-needed-when-the-collection-of-sets-is-finite/2167798).

[Axiom of Choice and finite sets](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/132717/axiom-of-choice-and-finite-sets).

> The ability to give a name to some arbitrary element of a nonempty set is known as "existential instantiation". This is an inference rule of the underlying logic, not part of the theory, and so it is included not only in ZFC, but also in ZF, and in appropriate forms it is also included in PA and every other first-order theory.

> Making one choice is simple, if a set A is not empty, then ∃a(a∈A), and therefore we can pick such a. This is called existential instantiation. But this choice is completely arbitrary. 

> However making infinitely many arbitrary choices is something we cannot prove to be possible1. 

> Remember that arbitrary sets have absolutely no structure. We only have ∈ in our language, and we have sets and their elements. Sometimes we are lucky and the elements of the set are nice enough to allow for a definable way of choosing from them. For example if the empty set is a member or something.

> A common misconception is that countable choice has an inductive nature and is therefore provable as a theorem (in ZF, or similar, or even weaker systems) by induction. However, this is not the case; this misconception is the result of confusing countable choice with finite choice for a finite set of size n (for arbitrary n), and it is this latter result (which is an elementary theorem in combinatorics) that is provable by induction. 

> The axiom of choice is a generalization of finiteness. It's related (by, for instance, the compactness theorem in logic, and Tychonoff's theorem in topology) to topological compactness, which is another generalization of finiteness.

> Without the axiom of choice, you can sometimes specify a choice: "Pick the left shoe from each pair." If you can make (read: define) such a specification, you don't need the axiom of choice, because you can point to that specification as your choice.

> In an informal sense, the axiom of choice says you can always take an infinite number of (certain kinds of) steps in finite time. (?)

> But the first ellipsis doesn't actually make sense in logic. No mathematical logic rules allow an infinite number of quantifiers. The axiom of choice sort of says, "That's okay, it still works." 

> On the other hand, you can define the "left shoe" choice with only a finite number of quantifiers.

> we can see the pairing axiom (which asserts that (x,y,z) is a set) doing the work of compressing n existence quantifiers into one.

> I want to make it clear that there is no actual choosing going on here. It is
> not required that there be any rule to find a particular element of A - they
> might be "indistinguishable socks" for all we care. It doesn't matter,
> because *the ambiguity of the original choices has been off-loaded to
> ambiguity in the output element of A×B×C.*

> The problem with this method is that pairing only works for n=2, or by

> when dealing with a finite number of sets you can explicitly write the function in the form of a formula. However, in the infinite case you cannot write this sort of formula (it would require infinitely many quantifiers to mention which element is chosen) and therefore you're in need of a stronger tool that would guarantee the existence of such function

> If we can't explicitly define any particular y, then we won't be able to define any particular choice function either, but the problem doesn't require us to explicitly define a choice function

[Do We Need the Axiom of Choice for Finite Sets?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/132717/do-we-need-the-axiom-of-choice-for-finite-sets)

> The matter of the axiom of choice is not to choose among an infinite set, but make an infinity of choice.

> The ability to give a name to some arbitrary element of a nonempty set is known as "existential instantiation". This is an inference rule of the underlying logic, not part of the theory, and so it is included not only in ZFC, but also in ZF, and in appropriate forms it is also included in PA and every other first-order theory. 

> The intuition is that giving a name to an object does not really require "choosing" an object; if we know that there is an element in a set A, and we begin arguing about some "given" element c∈A, we do not have to actually make a choice, we can just reason hypothetically ("what if we knew an element c of A?")

> This reasoning will be sound because A really is nonempty. However, because we don't know which element is chosen, the only properties we know it has are the ones we can prove every element of A has. In particular, we cannot assume that the element we are given is equal to any other object we already have, unless we can prove they are equal. So we need to give a new name that we are not already using for any other object.

> You might be thinking that "choosing" a single element from a set would be an algorithmic operation, but this is just not the case. The nonconstructivity of existential instantiation is a direct consequence of the nonconstructive meaning of ∃ in classical logic. To get a system where you can effectively choose a witness to any true existential statement, you have to move to constructive mathematics, but then the meaning of ∃ changes as well.

> Saying S is not empty, therefore there is an x∈S, does not suffice.

> Ah, but it does suffice! 

> The axiom of choice, as said, allows us to choose from infinitely many sets at once (sometimes even when these sets are finite!). If, however, one only wishes to choose from finitely many sets then this can be done without it. It does not even matter if the sets themselves are finite or not.

[Why is the axiom of choice required for infinite, but not finite, sets?](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-axiom-of-choice-required-for-infinite-but-not-finite-sets)

> The axiom of choice is still required to prove that a choice function exists for an infinite family of finite sets. That a choice function exists for a finite family of sets (of whatever size) can be proven in ZF without the axiom of choice.

> For a finite family  R , the axiom of choice is not required, because we can prove by induction that a choice function exists.

> The English mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell gave the following succinct example of this distinction: “To choose one sock from each of infinitely many pairs of socks requires the Axiom of Choice, but for shoes the Axiom is not needed.”

> Bertrand Russell summed it up neatly: "To choose one sock from each of infinitely many pairs of socks requires the Axiom of Choice, but for shoes the Axiom is not needed. His point is that the two socks in a pair are identical in appearance, so, to pick one of them, we have to make an arbitrary choice. For shoes, we can use an explicit rule, such as "always choose the left shoe." Russell specifically mentions infinitely many pairs, because if the number is finite then AC is superfluous: we can pick one member of each pair using the definition of "nonempty" and then repeat the operation finitely many times using the rules of formal logic.

[Does the axiom of choice have any use for finite sets?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1657972/does-the-axiom-of-choice-have-any-use-for-finite-sets)

> Even for (infinite setts of) pairs the axiom of choice is does not follow from ZF if one looks at an infinite collection.

>  If you mean that the family of sets itself is finite, then AC can be proved in ZF by induction, i.e., it is automatic, but this is only true if your background logic is classical. For intuitionistic logic, the axiom of choice can be very powerful even for finite sets. For example, there is a theorem that the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle; in this sense the introduction of AC "defeats" the intuitionistic logic and turns the situation into a classical one.

> There is a precise sense in which the concept of field is not algebraic like, say, the concept of ring or group or vector space etc.: it is a theorem that any kind of mathematical structure that is defined as having a set of elements and some fixed list of total operations of constant finite arity obeying some fixed list of unconditional equations gives rise to a category with certain nice properties (which I omit for the moment). The usual definition of field has a partially defined operation – inversion – as well as an inequality (0≠1), which means the theorem is not applicable; the fact that the category of fields does not have the nice properties of algebraic categories tells us there is actually no way of defining fields so that the theorem applies.
