[Is there much difference between using nix-shell and docker for local development?](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/is-there-much-difference-between-using-nix-shell-and-docker-for-local-development/807)

> You need to see a Docker image as a snapshot of a machine. It will stay like it is and thus anything you do with it will keep working. However, making changes to such an image is where nondeterminism seeps in. Docker images are built using shell commands, usually it contains commands like apt-get update, apt-get install ... or wget .... These fetch information from outside sources, but because the outside sources change over time will result in different files being fetched at different times. In addition, there are no checks that the files that are being fetched are actually the ones you intended to download for your Docker image. So, Docker images will stay the same, but building the Docker image will result in a different result each time you build it. No guarantees there. Nix is different in the sense that the build process itself is resttricted so that no outside sources can change without that change being detected. Builds will result in functionally the same thing each time it is run. That also makes making changes safer, as a change requires a rebuild.

> Another area that nix-shell is better is composability. You can potentially maintain common nix expressions among your many projects, and the shared build dependencies will only need to be built once. This could potentially greatly speed up your ability to work on a lot of small projects, if the alternative is you have to build a separate Docker container for each one.

> With Docker, you can share and cache the layers of containers, but you have to figure out how to order your layers to maximize sharing, and sometimes it is not possible to get all the sharing you need because two dependencies are kind of at the same layer.

> Nix builds a package in isolation from your system. This ensures that build process is reproducible and doesn’t have undeclared dependencies, so if a package is built on one machine, it will build identically on another machine.

> Comparing to Stack, Nix also have the advantage that we can host private Haskell packages, or even private distributions with Nix. The expressiveness of Nix makes it possible to add or remove packages, apply private patches to packages, use upstream or unpublished packages, and pin some packages to specific versions. When working on multi-language projects, Nix also makes it easy to integrate Haskell projects to a larger system and manage them as a whole.

> Nix is a language-independent build tool. This means you can use Nix to also build and customize non-Haskell dependencies (like gtk). This uniform language simplifies build tooling and infrastructure.

> Both Nix and stack use curated package sets instead of version bounds for dependency management. stack calls these package sets "resolvers" whereas Nix calls these package sets "channels". Nix provides stable channels with names like NixOS-18.09 (analogous to stack's LTS releases) and then an unstable channel named nixpkgs-unstable (analogous to stack's nightly releases)

> However, I'm also a member of another group of users: those who make heavy use of Nix. For a number of reasons, Nix is very popular amongst the Haskell community, and nixpkgs builds a huge number of Haskell packages. And many of the industrial users are quite tightly wedded to it - for things like cross-compilation there are few compelling alternatives.

> Now, most people using Nix to build Haskell packages do use Cabal. nixpkgs uses the lower-level Setup.hs machinery, but of course that still depends heavily on Cabal as a library.

> cabal2nix converts Haskell projects to nix expressions based on the currently available package set in nixpkgs. This usually follows stackage. If your Haskell project works with this, then it is probably the most convenient way to get started. You get the benefit of using the binary cache, so you don’t even need to build much.

> It quickly gets frustrating when your dependencies don’t match what is available in the default package set. You begin to start needing to override the packages to get the exact dependencies you want, and this can quickly get out of hand.

> I’ve recently been playing with https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix 5 which take the approach of conjuring up the package set you need using cabals solver (or stacks). It then builds a nix expression which matches exactly what cabal or stack would do at that point in time, and allows you to reproduce it whenever. This is much easier to work with as you can just use your normal tools to come up with the build plan, and simply use nix for caching and reproducibility (check in the generated nix files much like you would a cabal lock file).

> This might be desirable in many cases, but for us it means a lot of waiting for no benefit. We can avoid this by pinning nixpkgs to a known-good commit. One way to do this is by setting the NIX_PATH environment variable, which is where Nix looks for the location of nixpkgs. We could do this as follows:

[Nix PhD thesis](https://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf)

> From the thesis: "Nix expressions are [...] translated to [...] store derivations, which encode single component build actions. [Just as] compilers generally do the bulk of their work on simpler intermediate representations of the code being compiled, rather than on a full-blown language with all its complexities. [...] Nix expressions are first translated to store derivations that live in the Nix store and that each describe a single build action with all variability removed. These store derivations can then be built, which results in derivation outputs that also live in the Nix store."

> Needing to pass `-A` to a lot of commands to use them the "right way" smells of a poorly thought out design.

> Nix isolates packages, such that updating one package has no impact on any other packages (with unavoidable exceptions like the graphics driver, presumably).

> You're right that package isolation isn't much of a problem on non-rolling distros. One of the benefits of Nix is that you get some of the stability and predictability of an LTS distro with the freshness of a rolling distro when desired, without having to deal with package conflicts.

> Incidentally, Nix doesn't need to be used in a deterministic manner. In fact, I don't think most desktop users of Nix care too much about determinism for most packages they run. I certainly don't; I'm happy to follow along with whatever arrives in my channel. Nix has features that support determinism, and I'm certainly glad they exist for when I end up needing them, but they're not necessarily why people use Nix.

> Next, default.nix isn't used only for nix-build. For example, <nixpkgs/lib/default.nix> is used as aggregator for functions, and doesn't contain derivations. So not every default.nix is supposed to be "built" (but if default.nix is an attribute set of derivations, it will be buildable, and nix-build will build all of them).

> Next, nix-shell will use default.nix if no shell.nix is found.

> Next, default.nix is used as default file when importing directory. So if you write x = import ./some/directory;, then ./some/directory/default.nix will be imported.

> In general though, nativeBuildInputs is useful for cross-compilation as commands from those derivations will be available on the hostPlatform and execute at build time.

[overrideAttrs vs. overrideDerivation](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-pkg-override)

> Note that separateDebugInfo is processed only by the stdenv.mkDerivation function, not the generated, raw Nix derivation. Thus, using overrideDerivation will not work in this case, as it overrides only the attributes of the final derivation. It is for this reason that overrideAttrs should be preferred in (almost) all cases to overrideDerivation, i.e. to allow using stdenv.mkDerivation to process input arguments, as well as the fact that it is easier to use (you can use the same attribute names you see in your Nix code, instead of the ones generated (e.g. buildInputs vs nativeBuildInputs), and it involves less typing).

> Barring an event like the garbage collection of the Nix store or a change in the expression above, we would like to never rebuild this package again.

>  If we later update this by running $ nix-channel --update and any of the transitive dependencies of our expression are updated, this will cause a rebuild because Nix will rightly detect that the inputs have changed.

[Here’s a short overview of the different ways to produce a derivation with the Haskell stuff in Nixpkgs](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/why-are-these-derivations-so-different/18257/3)

> Just like stdenv, haskellPackages provides a mkDerivation function. haskellPackages also provides a callPackage function that works similarly to the top-level callPackage. If you dig through the above files, you’ll find that they are defined here:

> This generic Haskell builder is effectively a wrapper around stdenv.mkDerivation for specifically building Haskell packages.

> If you pass this function (or file) to haskellPackages.callPackage, it knows how to automatically find the arguments for Haskell packages like aeson, lens, etc. It also knows to fall back to looking for packages in the top-level Nixpkgs for things that aren’t Haskell libraries. So things like fetchgit, lib, etc will be pulled from the top-level Nixpkgs.

> It is admittedly somewhat confusing that haskellPackages.mkDerivation and stdenv.mkDerivation are named the same, but (completely) different functions (as well as callPackage).

> haskellPackages.callCabal2nix internally uses IFD 1, with all its advantages and disadvantages.

[Motivation for haskell.nix](https://input-output-hk.github.io/haskell.nix/motivation.html)

The Haskell builder in nixpkgs builds a package sequentially, first the library then the executables and finally the tests. It then executes the tests before the package is considered done. The upshot of this is that packages are only considered done if the test-suites passed. The downside is that if you have to compile multiple packages the likelihood of them failing is low, you have unnecessarily serialized your build. In a more aggressive setting libraries could start building as early as their dependent libraries are built.

> Fixed Output Derivations (FODs)
These are the "leaves" of any build closure, in that, they do not refer to other derivations. These derivations are defined by their content. These derivations are easily differientiated because they will contain a sha256 (or other hash) which is used to enforce that an artifact is reproducible.

> One critical difference from evaluated derivations is that Fixed-Output derivations are able to have access to the network while fetching contents. This "impurity" is offset by enforcing that the hash matches, and reproducibility is delegated to the process which fetchs the assets.

> Many of the fetch* utilities in nixpkgs and nix's builtins will create FODs.

In most cases, it’s more manageable than forking nixpkgs and managing your own long-running branch. NixOS also doesn’t provide a standard way to have other package sets so it makes sense to have them all in one. Those two reasons are what made them popular.

> We need at least one instance of nixpkgs (per system). The question is who is going to hold it.

> For fixed-output derivations, on the other hand, the name of the output path only depends on the outputHash* and name attributes

> The #1 reason we use fixed-output derivations is for network downloads. Since we cannot control the network, we disable it during builds to help with reproducibility.

> But what if we do need to download something? We make a compromise: if you’re a fixed-output derivation we enable network access for you, but in return tell me in advance the hash of what you’re going to download and give back as output. This way we retain reproducibility.

> Irrespective of the build tool being used, when constructing a derivation the problem facing Nix developers is always the same: how do we capture the build dependencies in a reproducible fashion?

> So we have a Gradle-based application, and we want to package it with Nix. The derivation for that might look something like this:

> Well except for one problem: derivations don’t have network access.

> If you were to try and build this derivation you would have Gradle complaining that it can’t resolve any dependencies. We have to work around this limitation, and we do that with a fixed-output derivation.

> Whilst normal derivations are not allowed network access, fixed-output derivations are a compromise for situations like this. They are provided with network access but in return they must declare in advance a hash of their contents.

> Essentially what we have done here is to create an offline Maven repository.

[Restrict fixed-output derivations (2018)](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/2270)

> For example, fetchcargo in Nixpkgs takes a Cargo.lock file as an input and produces an output containing all the dependencies specified in the Cargo.lock file. This is impure, but it works because fetchcargo is a fixed-output derivation. Such impurities are bad for reproducibility because the dependencies on external files are completely implicit: there is no way to tell from the derivation graph that the derivation depends on a bunch of crates fetched from the Internet.

> I don't like the idea where nix tries to solve all package managers in the world at all. There is already enough magic with lang2nix tools, and I don't see what is wrong with approach that we have for rust and go, where are we able to produce deterministic package depenency set. It is not nice and shiny, but reduces magic and gets the job done.

> Ok if I understand correctly, the problem is that fixed output derivations can be arbitrary complex as there are no boundaries from where information can be retrieved from internet. At the same time you lose dependency graph and it becomes time consuming to rebuild fixed output derivations.

> Yeah, I mean, I just don't see this as very realistic. I need a pijul fetcher among other things that simply do not will not ever belong in Nix.

Declarative configuration can manage only the static portion of this state. Dynamic data, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB data, cannot be effectively managed through declarative configuration(It is not feasible to delete all new PostgreSQL data that is not declared in the configuration during each deployment). Therefore, NixOS primarily focuses on managing a portion of the system state in a declarative manner. Dynamic data mentioned above, along with the contents in the user's home directory, remain unaffected by NixOS when rolling back to a previous generation.

> Note also that the flake registry by default sets nixpkgs to the unstable branch, and updates this automatically when you run nix commands after a time out of - I believe - a few hours. This is also why e.g. nix run nixpkgs#package will almost always download stuff by default (the latest nixpkgs unstable).

> In addition to the outputs of each input, each input in inputs also contains some metadata about the inputs. These are:

> outPath: The path in the Nix store of the flake's source tree. This way, the attribute set can be passed to import as if it was a path, as in the example above (import nixpkgs). [NOT RECOMMENDED, USE legacyPackages INSTEAD]

> Curious observation: dynamic linking on NixOS is not entirely dynamic. Because executables expect to find shared libraries in specific locations marked with hashes of the libraries themselves, it’s not possible to just upgrade .so on disk for all the binaries to pick it up.

> `patchelf` solves a different problem: it fixes up an already built binary. Here, I am building the binary myself, so I’d rather make that just work without any extra build steps.
