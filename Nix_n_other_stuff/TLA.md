[review at "path sensitive"](http://www.pathsensitive.com/2019/05/book-review-practical-tla.html)

> Reducing the system to a model requires another idea unfamiliar to many programmers: how all the questions about timeouts and schedulers and inputs boil down to “and here a nondeterministic action may occur.”

>  There are also many temporal properties that TLA+ cannot express, such as “Until an action is committed, a user may abort the action at any point.”

> new paradigms are valuable when they take concepts that are implicit in software design and give them syntax and compiler errors. For TLA+, these concepts are: modeling, nondeterminism, and temporal correctness properties.
