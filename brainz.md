Things to try:

- generate text
- generate text from examples given in the prompt ittself (?)
- suggest improvements to existing text
- change style of existing text (?)
- summarize text (perhaps down to only a few words)

> For ChatGPT 3, the current date is inserted into a long pre-prompt, along

> OpenAI confirm this approach in their general GPT documentation.

[The whole thing is parasitic on a substrate of solid technical writing](https://twitter.com/kevinbaker/status/1638974920074960896)
