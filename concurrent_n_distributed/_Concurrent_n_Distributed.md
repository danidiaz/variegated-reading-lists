>  real systems have metastable states, which surprises people. "Metastable" means that the system runs fine for a while, then something bad happens, the system goes into a bad state, and stays in the bad state after the bad stimulus is removed. Historically one of the first examples is the infamous Internet congestion collapse of 1986, which prompted the implementation of TCP congestion control.

[Strong consistency models](https://aphyr.com/posts/313-strong-consistency-models)

> Because serializability allows arbitrary reordering of operations (so long as the order appears atomic), it is not particularly useful in real applications. Most databases which claim to provide serializability actually provide strong serializability, which has the same time bounds as linearizability. To complicate matters further, what most SQL databases term the SERIALIZABLE consistency level actually means something weaker, like repeatable read, cursor stability, or snapshot isolation.

> Consistency means linearizability, and in particular, a linearizable register.

[Linearizability versus Serializability](http://www.bailis.org/blog/linearizability-versus-serializability/)

> Serializability is the traditional “I,” or isolation, in ACID. If users’ transactions each preserve application correctness (“C,” or consistency, in ACID), a serializable execution also preserves correctness. Therefore, serializability is a mechanism for guaranteeing database correctness.1

> Granted, serializability is (more or less) the most general means of maintaining database correctness. In what’s becoming one of my favorite “underground” (i.e., relatively poorly-cited) references, H.T. Kung and Christos Papadimitriou dropped a paper in SIGMOD 1979 on “An Optimality Theory of Concurrency Control for Databases.” In it, they essentially show that, if all you have are transactions’ syntactic modifications to database state (e.g., read and write) and no information about application logic, serializability is, in some sense, “optimal”: in effect, a schedule that is not serializable might modify the database state in a way that produces inconsistency for some (arbitrary) notion of correctness that is not known to the database.

> Combining serializability and linearizability yields strict serializability: transaction behavior is equivalent to some serial execution, and the serial order corresponds to real time. For example, say I begin and commit transaction T1, which writes to item x, and you later begin and commit transaction T2, which reads from x. A database providing strict serializability for these transactions will place T1 before T2 in the serial ordering, and T2 will read T1’s write. A database providing serializability (but not strict serializability) could order T2 before T1.2

> As Herlihy and Wing note, “linearizability can be viewed as a special case of strict serializability where transactions are restricted to consist of a single operation applied to a single object.”

[Please stop calling databases CP or AP](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html)

> Moreover, databases with snapshot isolation/MVCC are intentionally non-linearizable, because enforcing linearizability would reduce the level of concurrency that the database can offer. For example, **PostgreSQL’s SSI provides serializability but not linearizability**, and Oracle provides neither. Just because a database is branded “ACID” doesn’t mean it meets the CAP theorem’s definition of consistency. *Is this quote really correct?*

> the 'A' in CAP is boring. It does not mean what you think it means. Lynch et al. probably chose the definition because it's one for which the 'theorem' is both true and easy to prove. This is not the impossibility result with which designers of distributed systems should be most concerned.

> I don't want to ever see the phrase "Exactly Once" without several asterisks behind it. It might be exactly once from an "overall" point of view, but the client effectively needs infinitely durable infinite memory to perform the "distributed transaction" of acting on the message and responding to the server.

> Providing API for building applications that have transactions and help with idempotent producing is really exciting. This will help lower a lot of pains associated with building stream processing systems. Doing it with very little performance overhead is amazing.

> Indeed. Idempotent operations is the mainstay of managing "at least once" message delivery. If you had a true "exactly once" system, idempotency would be unnecessary.

[Manage Kubernetes Clusters on AWS Using Kops](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14715425)

[Docker & AWS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14853649)

> The problem with renting boxes is the hidden costs if you want to do it right. First of all, if you have anything mission critical, you need to run it in a high availability config, this is easy for stateless microservices, but when it comes to running your DB, you start renting three boxes instead of one or two and configuring them accordingly. And then you setup your Backup Infrastructure for disaster recovery, Glacier needs a replacement after all. No problem, just more disks(?) on a few more boxes(?) and bacula(?), better in a different Datacenter just to be on the safe side, it would be nasty if you whole rack gets fried and your data with it. Don't forget to backup your configuration, all of it. Loadbalancers, Server Environment Variables, Network (do you have an internal DNS?), Crontabs, some businesses need their audit logs stored etc...  On the infrastructure level there is lots and lots of stuff you can do and you won't ever really need AWS, you'll just spend significantly more time finding and administering the right solutions than just using the AWS Solutions where you'll find a treasure trove of great tutorials and can relatively cheaply pay for support.  If you then pay someone on top for 24/7 management/monitoring of your dedicated stack so that your team doesn't have to get up at 3 am because one of your VMs disk fills because some stray logfile is filling the disc, many of the savings you had by setting it up on a dedicated server go out of the window because the management partner needs to train their people to look into your infrastructure. AWS only Management Partners are just light-years cheaper because they can streamline their processes much better.  You could also hire your own team of admins...  Sure AWS is a beast with its own surprises, but overall the cost/benefit ratio is still very fair even if you factor in all the "surprises"(many of which your management partner will probably know about). Having layered support is really something beneficial aswell.  If something is wonky with RDS, you get to call your management partner if he didn't detect it before you, who if he can't tackle it himself can call AWS technicians. This gets you much much further than you would get elsewhere. The outside the world is paying for (for example) perconas consultants or someone similar if the problems grow over their team's head.  Sure, at some point in a companies growth, depending on how technical the operation is, there might be a time where an admin team and colocation/dedicated boxes make sense, where AWS technicians will scratch their heads etc., especially if you have some very very specific tasks you need to do.  But for most people this is far off if ever.

[Serializability, linearizability, and locality](https://aphyr.com/posts/333-serializability-linearizability-and-locality)

> Recall that strict serializability is essentially serializability plus linearizability’s real-time constraint: transactions cannot be arbitrarily re-ordered, but must appear to take place atomically at some time between their invocation and completion. When we add real-time constraints to sequential consistency, we get linearizability: a local property. Why can’t we add real-time constraints to serializability and obtain locality? Why don’t real-time multi-object transactions compose?

> We can view strict serializability as linearizability plus the multi-object transactions of serializability. But in another sense, linearizability is strict serializability with the constraint that transactions are constrained to act on a single object, because that restriction provides locality.

[Visualizing Linearizability](http://mwhittaker.github.io/2015/01/24/linearizability/)

[Linearizability: A Correctness Condition for Concurrent Objects (1990)](https://www.javagists.com/convenience-factory-methods-collections-java-9)

> Sequential consistency is equivalent to linearizability without condition L2. Serializability is analogous to sequential consistency with transactions, and strict serializability is analogous to linearizability with transactions. Sequential consistency, serializability, and strict serializability do not have the same locality and non-blocking properties as linearizability. Moreover, serializability and linearizability are for different domains. Serializability works well for databases because application developers should be able to easily express complex transactions. Linearizability is better for infrastructure in which the developer is willing to spend considerable effort to maximize concurrency.

[Consensus Protocols: Two-Phase Commit](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/consensus-protocols-two-phase-commit/)

[Consensus Protocols: Three-Phase Commit](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/consensus-protocols-three-phase-commit/)

[Consensus Protocols: Paxos](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/consensus-protocols-paxos/)

> 3PC works very well when nodes may crash and come to a halt – leaving the protocol permanently when they encounter a fault. This is called the fail-stop fault model, and certainly describes a number of failures that we see every day. However, especially in networked systems, this isn’t the only way in which nodes crash. They may instead, upon encountering a fault, crash and then recover from the fault, to begin executing happily from the point that they left off (remember that, with stable storage that persists between crashes, there’s no reason that a restarted node couldn’t simply pick up the protocol from where it crashed). This is the fail-recover fault model, which is more general than fail-stop, and therefore a bit more tricky to deal with.

> Similarly, heavy network load can delay the delivery of a message for an arbitrary period. In a synchronous network model, there is a bound on the amount of time a remote host can take to process and respond to a message. In an asynchronous model, no such bound exists. The key problem that asynchronicity causes is that time outs can no longer be reliably used as a proxy for failure detection

> There are other ways that Paxos can go wrong. Acceptors need to keep a record of the highest proposal they have agreed to, and the value of any proposals they have accepted, in stable storage. If that storage should crash then the acceptor cannot take part in the protocol for fear of corrupting the execution (by effectively lying about the proposals it has already seen). This is a kind of Byzantine failure, where an acceptor deviates from the protocol.

> Rather than sacrifice correctness, which some variants (including the one I described) of 3PC do, Paxos sacrifices liveness, i.e. guaranteed termination, when the network is behaving asynchronously and terminates only when synchronicity returns.

[In distributed systems, what is a simple explanation of the Paxos algorithm?](https://www.quora.com/In-distributed-systems-what-is-a-simple-explanation-of-the-Paxos-algorithm)

> 3PC is fail-stop resilient, but not fail-recover resilient. Unfortunately real life requires fail-recover and hence we need a more general solution. This is where Paxos comes in.

> What happens if we mandate only one Leader at a time in Paxos, and also mandate that instead of majority, all nodes must vote? You are right – we get 2PC. 2PC is a specific case of Paxos.

[Byzantine faults, Paxos, and consensus](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~emery/classes/cmpsci691st/scribe/lecture17-byz.pdf)

> Paxos is in a sense sort of like RSA. RSA is expensive, so you use it as a wrapper to a cheaper protocol.
With Paxos you elect a leader to be in charge of a large-scale event. The coordinator is a single point of
failure, so you can use paxos to come up with a new coordinator. Most of the time you don’t run paxos, you
only run it when something bad happens to prevent any one thing to be a single point of failure.

> So Paxos is a better, more general version of 2PC, and unlike 3PC, is has been proved correct?

[A Comparison of Advanced, Modern Cloud Databases](https://brandur.org/cloud-databases)

> Concurrent ACID: Whether the database supports ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) guarantees across multiple operations. ACID is a powerful tool for system correctness, and until recently has been a long sought but illusive chimera for distributed databases. I use the term “concurrent ACID” because technically Cosmos guarantees ACID, but only within the confines of a single operation.

> modern techniques can achieve CP while still keeping availability that’s incredibly good. Like five or more 9s of good. This result is so optimal that modern databases seem to be converging on it. Every database on the list above is CP with varying levels of A

> Time-based consistency. Sophisticated distributed systems like Spanner and CockroachDB tend to need a little more time to coordinate and verify the accuracy of the results that will be returned from any given node, and this makes them less suitable for low latency operations.

[Distributed consensus revised](https://pwlconf.org/2019/heidi-howard/)

> Distributed consensus, the ability to reach agreement in the face of failures and asynchrony, is a fundamental and powerful primitive for constructing reliable distributed systems from unreliable components. For over two decades, the Paxos algorithm has been synonymous with distributed consensus. Paxos is widely deployed in production systems, yet it is poorly understood and it proves to be heavyweight, unscalable and unreliable in practice.
