>  a kind of interesting tradeoff in distributed databases: using consensus to store your data, or using consensus to point at the master for the data.

> Replicating data in consensus groups gives some nice guarantees, in particular it can guarantee monotonic read consistency even if you're not reading from the leader, at the cost of a network round-trip. Switching between master-slave replicas might cause you to go back and forth in time, even if replication is synchronous.

> There are also some potential availability benefits to storing data in consensus groups, though most implementations use leader leases to improve performance, which reduces availability in case of leader failure. A master-slave system that does synchronous replication could do failovers that are just as fast as leader changes in a consensus protocol.

> The pain of storing data in consensus groups is in performance, especially concurrency. Every write to the log requires some synchronization with a quorum to ensure consensus on the order. That introduces extra round-trips and makes it hard to handle high concurrency.
