> There’s one more special case: when a relative clause refers not to a specific noun, but to an entire preceding clause or a nonspecific pronoun, German often uses “was” (which usually means “what”) as the relative pronoun. 

> Relative clauses don't always start simply with a relative pronoun. If the noun and the verb in the relative clause are linked with a preposition, then the preposition comes before the relative pronoun.

> A big difference from English is that the relative clause can be positioned much more freely. In English, you usually put it right after the noun you're referring to. In German, you can move it back, often into the Nachfeld (the position after the final verb). The gender of the relative pronoun tells the listener what noun you're referring to.
