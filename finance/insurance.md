> When placing a risk through Lloyd’s, the broker can use one or multiple
> syndicates, depending on the requirements of the business. The first
> syndicate to agree to write a risk is referred to as the “lead” syndicate.
> When there is more than one syndicate participating on a risk, it is called a
> “subscription market,” as the syndicates together subscribe to the contract
> document, or “slip.” This slip historically contained all the coverage and
> contract conditions relating to the risk, as well as deductibles, premiums,
> and other related information about the policy.  

> The policy wording is also included within the slip, which is the first
> document the claims department reaches for when advised of a new loss.
