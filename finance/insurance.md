> When placing a risk through Lloyd’s, the broker can use one or multiple
> syndicates, depending on the requirements of the business. The first
> syndicate to agree to write a risk is referred to as the “lead” syndicate.
> When there is more than one syndicate participating on a risk, it is called a
> “subscription market,” as the syndicates together subscribe to the contract
> document, or “slip.” This slip historically contained all the coverage and
> contract conditions relating to the risk, as well as deductibles, premiums,
> and other related information about the policy.  

> The policy wording is also included within the slip, which is the first
> document the claims department reaches for when advised of a new loss.

## Books

[Fundamentals of Risk and Insurance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17628260-fundamentals-of-risk-and-insurance)

> "[...] because insurers had not maintained loss data in a form that indicates the proportion of liability losses attributable to pain and sufferring, punitive damages, or contingency fees, they had difficulty in judging the amount by which the [tort] reforms were likely to reduce future losses. As a result, many states enacted legislation requiring insurers to accumulate loss data according to categories whta will permit measurement of such factors in the future."

[Tax Law Design and Drafting](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/nft/1998/tlaw/eng/). [ ch 16 Taxation of Income from Business and Investment ](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/nft/1998/tlaw/eng/ch16.pdf).

> The relationship between the determination of business income for tax purposes and
financial accounting rules is analyzed in detail in the appendix to this chapter. Those materials
note that the principal purpose of financial accounting is to provide an accurate analysis of the
profitability of an entity to the managers and owners of an entity, as well as to creditors and
potential outside investors. Income tax, in contrast, is concerned with the measurement of the net
economic gain of a taxpayer in a fixed period for the purpose of collecting a portion of the gain
as tax. These differences explain why classifications used in one system may not be relevant to
the other. For example, because financial accounting is concerned with presenting owners,
creditors, and investors with an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of an entity, it
places some emphasis on classifying gains by reference to their regularity.

> Not all business taxpayers are required to compile comprehensive accounting records that
include balance sheets. Accordingly, in jurisdictions that use the balance-sheet method to
calculate taxable business income, smaller businesses operated by sole traders and self-employed
persons (particularly those that account on a cash basis)10 may be allowed to calculate income as
the difference between taxable receipts and deductible expenses.11

> An endorsement, also known as a rider, adds, deletes, excludes or changes insurance coverage. An
endorsement/rider can also be used to increase standard limits of coverage and take precedent over the original
agreement or policy.
> How an Insurance Endorsement/Rider Works
> An insurance endorsement/rider is an amendment to an existing insurance contract that changes the terms of the
original policy. An endorsement/rider can be issued at the time of purchase, mid-term or at renewal time.
Insurance premiums may be affected and adjusted as a result.

> Business deductibles are considerably more complex than individual deductibles and require a great deal more record-keeping. A business or self-employed individual must list all of the income that was received and all of the expenses that were paid out in order to report the real profit of the business. That profit is the gross taxable income of the business.

> A tax deducible lowers your gross income to arrive at an adjusted gross income. There are a variety of deductibles, depending on if an individual qualifies for them. The deductible amount is applied to an individual's income, which reduces their income by the deductible amount, which results in having a lower income and, therefore, a lower tax bill.

> The net operating loss (NOL) deduction is one of the rare exceptions to the general income tax rule that your taxable income is determined solely on the basis of your current year's events. [...] The rules governing partnerships, S corporations and regular corporations are complex and their nuances are beyond the scope of this article.
