[Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

[Set up a WSL development environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password)

[Advanced settings configuration in WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config)

> .wslconfig to configure settings globally across all installed distributions running on WSL 2.
> Stored in your %UserProfile% directory.

> wsl.conf to configure settings per-distribution for Linux distros running on WSL 1 or WSL 2
> Stored in the /etc directory of the distribution as a unix file.

[Basic commands for WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands)

[Set Default WSL Linux Distro in Windows 10](https://winaero.com/set-default-wsl-linux-distro-windows-10/)

> A default WSL Linux distro is a distro that runs when you issue the "wsl"
> command without parameters. Also, it opens from the "Open Linux here" context
> menu command. 

[Working across Windows and Linux file systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems)

>  We recommend against working across operating systems with your files,
>  unless you have a specific reason for doing so. For the fastest performance
>  speed, store your files in the WSL file system if you are working in a Linux
>  command line (Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, etc). If you're working in a Windows command
>  line (PowerShell, Command Prompt), store your files in the Windows file
>  system.

> When you see /mnt/ in the file path of a WSL command line, it means that you
> are working from a mounted drive.

> You may notice when you open the environment that it has logged in as the
> root user instead of a custom user that you set up as part of the "base"
> environment. The custom user exists, but is not configured as the default.
> You can either start the environment using:
>
> wsl -d <new distribution name> -u <username>
>
> or you can create/update a wsl.conf file in the /etc directory inside the environment,

When doing the import, remember that you have to provide the directory in which
the new image file will be created.

Editing the wsl.conf file seems to work, before that, you enter the copied image as root.

> Services listening on ports in WSL-2 are accesible from the host machine as localhost:<port>

> WSL-2 ports are not accessible from outside of the host machine   

> WSL-2 ports can be made available through netstat interface portproxy or other portforward tools using the ip address of the WSL instance. 

> In WSL2, the instance is running in a Hyper-V VM with a virtual NIC that is NAT'd behind the Windows host. However, the Windows host itself should have direct access to services running in the instance through localhost. WSL appears to do some automatic port-forwarding, but only from the local Windows host to the WSL instance.
