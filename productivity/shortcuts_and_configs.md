[Advanced settings configuration in WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config)

> .wslconfig to configure settings globally across all installed distributions running on WSL 2.
> Stored in your %UserProfile% directory.

> wsl.conf to configure settings per-distribution for Linux distros running on WSL 1 or WSL 2
> Stored in the /etc directory of the distribution as a unix file.

[Basic commands for WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands)

[Set Default WSL Linux Distro in Windows 10](https://winaero.com/set-default-wsl-linux-distro-windows-10/)

> A default WSL Linux distro is a distro that runs when you issue the "wsl"
> command without parameters. Also, it opens from the "Open Linux here" context
> menu command. 

[Working across Windows and Linux file systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems)

>  We recommend against working across operating systems with your files,
>  unless you have a specific reason for doing so. For the fastest performance
>  speed, store your files in the WSL file system if you are working in a Linux
>  command line (Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, etc). If you're working in a Windows command
>  line (PowerShell, Command Prompt), store your files in the Windows file
>  system.

> When you see /mnt/ in the file path of a WSL command line, it means that you
> are working from a mounted drive.

> You may notice when you open the environment that it has logged in as the
> root user instead of a custom user that you set up as part of the "base"
> environment. The custom user exists, but is not configured as the default.
> You can either start the environment using:
>
> wsl -d <new distribution name> -u <username>
>
> or you can create/update a wsl.conf file in the /etc directory inside the environment,

When doing the import, remember that you have to provide the directory in which
the new image file will be created.

Editing the wsl.conf file seems to work, before that, you enter the copied image as root.

> Services listening on ports in WSL-2 are accesible from the host machine as localhost:<port>

> WSL-2 ports are not accessible from outside of the host machine   

> WSL-2 ports can be made available through netstat interface portproxy or other portforward tools using the ip address of the WSL instance. 

> In WSL2, the instance is running in a Hyper-V VM with a virtual NIC that is NAT'd behind the Windows host. However, the Windows host itself should have direct access to services running in the instance through localhost. WSL appears to do some automatic port-forwarding, but only from the local Windows host to the WSL instance.

> POSIX shells such as Bash have the globbing feature specifically for this purpose â€” to allow the shell to expand patterns into a list of matching filenames. There is no need to interpret the results of an external utility. Because globbing is the very last expansion step, each match of the ./*.mp3 pattern correctly expands to a separate word, and isn't subject to the effects of an unquoted expansion.

> Question: What happens if there are no *.mp3-files in the current directory? Then the for loop is executed once, with file="./*.mp3", which is not the expected behavior! The workaround is to test whether there is a matching file:

> https://getsling.com/blog/split-shift/ 

> A split shift is a type of work schedule in which you divide an employeeâ€™s workday into two or more parts.

> Itâ€™s important to understand that the regular one-hour lunch break associated with a 9-to-5 schedule doesnâ€™t count toward a split shift. A typical split shift is separated by two or more hours.

> As with all scheduling practices, only you, the manager, are allowed to call two separate work periods a split shift. An employee may leave for emergency or personal reasons (with your permission, of course) and then return to finish work, but that is not a split shift.

> Admin and Managers using the Business version of Sling have access to an auto-assign function.
