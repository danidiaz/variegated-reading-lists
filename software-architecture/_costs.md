> Would add that edge compute, running cloud paradigms (code instead of config; automation; management abstractions), partially addresses these limitations for many use cases.

> Costly to move the data off, but longer-term ROI for those orgs that are willing to make long-term decisions.

> Meanwhile, as edge matures, greenfield apps should be edge-centric, rather than cloud-centric (doesn't mean they won't have cloud components...they will do the processing and storage where it best makes sense).

> Once you have significant data on AWS it costs you so much to transfer it you are stuck with them. Their data fees are insane, and so are their storage fees.

> If you need a predefined small number of VMs and no other functionality, it would be silly to go with AWS. But on the other hand, if you want a set of servers of a given class spawning on demand, with traffic coming in via load balancers, with integrated certificate and DNS management, with programmable lifecycle hooks, with integrated authn/authz, with full audit logs and account management, with configurable private networking to other services, etc. etc. ... You'll pay more than the price difference for someone to implement all of that from scratch.
