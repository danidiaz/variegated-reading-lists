> To go to the top of the webpage, press the Ctrl and Home keys to get you there. 

- NVDA can use Caps Lock as NVDA key. If I use AutoHotKey to switch Caps Lock and Ctrl, it ignores the change and keeps using Caps Lock.

- Ctrl + Home to go to the top of the page is not a standard shortcut (application-dependent?) and doesn't work consistently, it seems. Maybe rely on heading navigation? H, 1, Shift-H, Shift-1, plus Ctrl-Up/Down for moving around?

[Hot to section your HTML](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-section-your-html/)

- The one major restriction around nesting sectioning elements is that headers and footers cannot be nested inside other headers and footers.

- sectioning element sets new heading level context

- Sectioning elements can be nested inside one another as many times as is needed based on the content. 

- The header and footer in a sectioning element can also contain sectioning elements.

- if you can’t think of a meaningful heading to apply to a <section>, then it probably shouldn’t be a <section>

- Avoid nesting an <aside> inside an <aside>

- <article> is a bit like the “B” (or “Block”) in BEM. It is a container that stores self-contained content that still makes sense when placed in a different context. Individual tweets on Twitter and each list item on a search results page would be considered <article> elements.

- <section> is like the “E” (or “Element”) in BEM. It is a sub-section that requires context from its parent sectioning element to make sense. <section> is a generic catch-all sectioning element that you use when it doesn’t make sense to use the other sectioning elements. So, if in doubt, go with <section>.

- Something that may surprise people is that individual comments on a blog post are also considered articles, even though they are in reply to the main blog post. 

[<article>: The Article Contents element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article#examples)

> The <article> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable

> Each article should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1 - h6 element) as a child of the article element.

> When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.

[<section>: The Generic Section element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section)

> The <section> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.

[Making the most of Landmark Roles](https://openinclusion.com/blog/making-the-most-of-landmark-roles/). [Accessible Landmarks](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2018/03/03/landmarks.html)

> Whilst using landmark roles properly is a great help to screen reader users, it is sensible not to over-use them. Too many landmarks will cause ‘user fatigue’ and will devalue their use.

[Should you use multiple <h1> heading elements on your page in 2022?](https://blog.shimin.io/should-you-use-multiple-h1-s-in-2022/). [accessible landmarks](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2018/03/03/landmarks.html).

> TL;DR: multiple h1s are technically on specification, but the document outline algorithm is dead so either create one h1 or split the page into 2 or more pages

> Using more than one h1 is allowed by the HTML specification, but is not considered a best practice. Using only one h1 is beneficial for screenreader users.

> Going through the HTML specification, it's pretty clear that using multiple h1s are allowed as long as they are contained in their own sectioning elements, such as article and section. There's even a whole section on the sections spec strongly encouraging authors to use h1s.

> But now you remember reading something on the MDN site about outlines and not being implemented.

> So you read the attached blog posts and found out that no browser has yet implemented this outline algorithm, which means your multiple h1 are treated like top-level landmarks by all screen readers. This is a nightmare to navigate for users using accessible technologies.

[Why <h1> in <header>?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12231112/why-h1-in-header)

> The header tag is not limited to only containing the h1, but as it is the most important header on the page, that may often be the case.

> G61: Presenting repeated components in the same relative order each time they appear

> The objective of this technique is to make content easier to use by making the placement of repeated components more predictable. This technique helps maintain consistent layout or presentation between Web pages by presenting components that are repeated in these Web units in the same relative order each time they appear. Other components can be inserted between them, but their relative order is not changed.

> G115: Using semantic elements to mark up structure

> G130: Providing descriptive headings

> Note that the level 2 headings have the distinguishing information at the beginning (ie, instead of "Preparation for floods", "Preparation for fires", etc).

> H44: Using label elements to associate text labels with form controls

> H51: Using table markup to present tabular information

> Usually, for simple tables, row 1 column 1 is either blank or describes the contents of the entire column 1. Row 1 columns are not blank (i.e. they contain "column headings"), describe the contents of the entire column, and allow the reader to distinguish the difference in meaning between that column and other columns.

> H43: Using id and headers attributes to associate data cells with header cells in data tables

> H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language

> This example demonstrates the use of the xml:lang attribute defining a quote written in German. This snippet could be included by an XHTML 1.1 document where lang is not allowed.

> Progressive enhancement is a way of building websites and applications. It’s based on the idea that you should start by making your page work with just HTML, before adding anything else like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.

> This is because HTML is the most resilient layer. If the HTML fails there’s no web page. Should the CSS or JavaScript fail, the HTML will still render correctly.

> <thead>, <tfoot>, and <tbody>, which allow you to mark up a header, footer, and body section for the table.

> These elements don't make the table any more accessible to screen reader users, and don't result in any visual enhancement on their own. They are however very useful for styling and layout — acting as useful hooks for adding CSS to your table.

> Note: <tbody> is always included in every table, implicitly if you don't specify it in your code. To check this, open up one of your previous examples that doesn't include <tbody> and look at the HTML code in your browser developer tools — you will see that the browser has added this tag for you. You might wonder why you ought to bother including it at all — you should, because it gives you more control over your table structure and styling.

> CSS Grid Layout lets you turn an element into a grid, and place the element’s direct children onto it. Given that, it might be tempting to use flatter markup, but less meaning is usually less accessibility. With display: contents, we can place grand children on a grid, which lets us have accessible markup and beautiful layout. Let’s dive into the details! [note: might subgrid be another solution here?]

> The purpose of this technique is to notify Assistive Technologies (AT) when an input error occurs. The aria-live attribute makes it possible for an AT (such as a screen reader) to be notified when error messages are injected into a Live Region container. The content within the aria-live region is automatically read by the AT, without the AT having to focus on the place where the text is displayed.
