> G61: Presenting repeated components in the same relative order each time they appear

> The objective of this technique is to make content easier to use by making the placement of repeated components more predictable. This technique helps maintain consistent layout or presentation between Web pages by presenting components that are repeated in these Web units in the same relative order each time they appear. Other components can be inserted between them, but their relative order is not changed.

> G115: Using semantic elements to mark up structure

> G130: Providing descriptive headings

> Note that the level 2 headings have the distinguishing information at the beginning (ie, instead of "Preparation for floods", "Preparation for fires", etc).

> H44: Using label elements to associate text labels with form controls

> H51: Using table markup to present tabular information

> Usually, for simple tables, row 1 column 1 is either blank or describes the contents of the entire column 1. Row 1 columns are not blank (i.e. they contain "column headings"), describe the contents of the entire column, and allow the reader to distinguish the difference in meaning between that column and other columns.

> H43: Using id and headers attributes to associate data cells with header cells in data tables

> H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language

> This example demonstrates the use of the xml:lang attribute defining a quote written in German. This snippet could be included by an XHTML 1.1 document where lang is not allowed.

[Building a resilient frontend using progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement). [tweet](https://twitter.com/accessibleweb/status/1575484706329571328)

> Progressive enhancement is a way of building websites and applications. It’s based on the idea that you should start by making your page work with just HTML, before adding anything else like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.

> This is because HTML is the most resilient layer. If the HTML fails there’s no web page. Should the CSS or JavaScript fail, the HTML will still render correctly.
