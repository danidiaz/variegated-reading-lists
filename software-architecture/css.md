[Why won't fr units work with grid-template-rows on CSS grid?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60941673/why-wont-fr-units-work-with-grid-template-rows-on-css-grid)

> Your container has no extra height. So there's no free space for the fr unit to distribute.

> Block elements consume the full width of their parent, by default. So you don't need to define width: 100%.

> Not so with height. Most elements are set by default to the height of their content (height: auto). So you need to define a height if you want the container to be taller than the content.

> Staying outside of any media queries we're now going to set up the layout for the mobile width. Here we're keeping everything in source order, trying to avoid any disconnect between the source and display as described in the guide Grid layout and accessibility

>  Grid layout gives authors great powers of rearrangement over the document. However, these are not a substitute for correct ordering of the document source. The order property and grid placement do not affect ordering in non-visual media (such as speech). Likewise, rearranging grid items visually does not affect the default traversal order of sequential navigation modes (such as cycling through links, see e.g. tabindex HTML5).

> Something to note as we create this layout is that we haven't needed to explicitly position every element on the grid at each breakpoint. We have been able to inherit the placement set up for earlier breakpoints – an advantage of working "mobile first".

> Many layouts are essentially sets of "cards" – product listings, image galleries, and so on. A grid can make it very easy to create these listings in a way that is responsive without needing to add media queries to make it so. 

> This is really one of the key reasons someone would use flexbox rather than grid, if he/she's just aligning or distributing something in a single dimension, that's a flexbox use case.

> This is all looking fairly complete now, however we sometimes have these cards which contain far more content than the others. It might be nice to cause those to span two tracks, and then they won't be so tall. We have a class of wide on my larger item, and we add a rule grid-column-end with a value of span 2.

> We can cause a grid to backfill those gaps by setting grid-auto-flow: dense on the grid container. Take care when doing this however as it does take items away from their logical source order. You should only do this if your items do not have a set order

> An element with role="table" is a static tabular structure with rows containing cells. The cells are not focusable or selectable, though widgets within individual cells of the table can be interactive. Using a native HTML <table> element whenever possible is strongly encouraged.

> Warning: If a table maintains a selection state, has two-dimensional navigation, or allows the user to rearrange cell order use grid or treegrid instead.

> a subgrid, a grid-item with its own grid that aligns in one or both dimensions with the parent grid

> For the uninitiated, one of the main constraints of CSS Grid Layout is that only the direct children of the grid container can be placed on the grid. This is why we can't use a simple display: grid on the cards' container to solve our problem; we could position the cards on the grid, rather boringly, but we can't position the cards' contents on the grid, because those elements are not direct children of the grid container element.

> Or can we?

> Enter display: contents. If you give a container element the rule display: contents, the element sort of... vanishes... at least for layout purposes. The surrounding elements are no longer aware of that container; instead, they see its direct children. What this means in a grid context is: if a grid item is given display: contents, its child elements become grid items instead!
