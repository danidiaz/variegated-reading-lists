It’s a prominent vehicle that typically runs in Kubernetes to control inter-pod and inter-service traffic from Kubernetes workloads. For this, Istio uses Kubernetes Mutating Admission Webhooks for automatically injecting a sidecar proxy into pods.

> "Managed Kubernetes" really runs the spectrum between "one step above just installing it yourself on a bunch of VMs" and "I spend 1% of my time managing anything below the product." Each cloud provider exists somewhere different on this spectrum, with none of them being in quite the same location, and some of them have multiple different products which exist at different points.

> For example: AWS is among the most bare-bones. EKS is just a managed control plane; coming from GKE, you might click "create an cluster" then be very confused how there are no options for, say, instance size, or how many... because you have to do that all yourself. There are tools like eksctl or Rancher which can help with this, but ultimately, you're managing those instances. You're doing capacity planning (you think kube would be a great pick to integrate with spot fleets because of its ability to schedule and move workloads to a new instance when one goes down? have fun setting it up, hope you like ops work.). You're doing auto-scaling (and that ASG? its not going to know about your pod resource requests, so you either need some very smart manual coordination between the two, or you need to set up cluster-autoscaler). You're setting up cluster metrics (definitely need metrics-server. not heapster, that was last year, metrics-server is this year. but how to visualize? do i host grafana in the cluster? then i need to worry about authn. cloudwatch really isn't made for these kinds of things... maybe I'll just give datadog a few thousand bucks.) Crap, 1.16 is out already? They only support 9 months of releases with security updates?! I feel like I just upgraded my nodes! Oh well, time to lose a day replicating this update across all of my environments.

> DigitalOcean is pretty similar to this (it does provision instances, but the tooling beyond that is barebones). Google Cloud/GKE is "more managed" in a few sense; the cloud dashboard provides some great management capabilities out-of-the-box, such that you may not need to reach for something like Datadog, and the autoscaler works really well without a lot of tinkering. There are still underlying instances, so you're worrying about ingress protection, OS hardening, OS upgrades, etc... but its not as bad as AWS. Not by a long shot.

> resources within a public cloud, a VPC is the answer.

> VPCs are essentially configurable private networks that can be made securely
> accessible to other networks or individuals through the use of VPNs.

[Aurora vs. RDS: Why Should You Choose Aurora Over Regular RDS?](https://blog.shikisoft.com/why-choose-aurora-over-regular-rds/)

> Amazon RDS is the managed relational database solution of AWS. You leave the
> setup and maintenance of your database to AWS and focus on building
> applications using it. You can launch and maintain community edition MySQL,
> PostgreSQL databases as well as commercial Oracle and SQL Server databases on
> Amazon RDS. However, a few years ago, AWS developed its own cloud-native,
> enterprise-level database engine called Amazon Aurora, which provides MySQL
> and PostgreSQL compatibility.  

> First of all, Amazon Aurora is neither MySQL nor PostgreSQL. It is a
> different, cloud-native database engine developed by AWS providing versions
> compatible with these two databases. You also launch and manage your Aurora
> database clusters with the help of Amazon RDS. This is why you see it on
> Amazon RDS Console. Besides, Aurora provides all the advantages of RDS.
> Hence, we can consider it as an enhanced version of Amazon RDS. 

> When you use regular Amazon RDS, the architecture is similar to installing it
> on Amazon EC2 manually but leaving the provisioning and maintenance to AWS.
> Of course, RDS provides many features like automatic failovers, backups, etc.
> However, in reality, you have an instance and an EBS [Elastic block store]
> volume attached to it.

> To achieve reliability on this architecture, you need to enable the Multi-AZ
> feature on your RDS instance and replicate it synchronously to a standby
> replica in another Availability Zone. So you gain two copies of your database
> in two availability zones.

> Because you flagged the new variables as sensitive, Terraform redacts their values from its output when you run a plan, apply, or destroy command. Notice that the password is marked sensitive value, while the username is marked sensitive. 

[Backend Configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration)

> A backend defines where Terraform stores its state data files.

> By default, Terraform uses a backend called local, which stores state as a local file on disk. 

> Some backends allow providing access credentials directly as part of the configuration for use in unusual situations, for pragmatic reasons. However, in normal use, we do not recommend including access credentials as part of the backend configuration. Instead, leave those arguments completely unset and provide credentials using the credentials files or environment variables that are conventional for the target system, as described in the documentation for each backend.

> Warning: We recommend using environment variables to supply credentials and other sensitive data. If you use -backend-config or hardcode these values directly in your configuration, Terraform will include these values in both the .terraform subdirectory and in plan files. This can leak sensitive credentials.

> The .terraform/terraform.tfstate file contains the backend configuration for the current working directory.

[The design of Terraform is to recompute variables on demand, and to not store the computed value in state.](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/2550#issuecomment-1283163244)

[Sensitive values in state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables#sensitive-values-in-state) does it contradict the above?

> When you run Terraform commands with a local state file, Terraform stores the state as plain text, including variable values, even if you have flagged them as sensitive. Terraform needs to store these values in your state so that it can tell if you have changed them since the last time you applied your configuration.

> Marking variables as sensitive is not sufficient to secure them. You must also keep them secure while passing them into Terraform configuration, and protect them in your state file. 

[Store Terraform state in a Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/resource-management/store-state)

> By default, Terraform stores state locally in a file named terraform.tfstate. This default configuration can make Terraform usage difficult for teams when multiple users run Terraform at the same time and each machine has its own understanding of the current infrastructure.

> When dealing with sensitive information I usually create passwords via Secrets Manager (AWS) and then use reference attributes to retrieve them or I'll store them in parameter store and import them using using the SSM Parameter data source.
