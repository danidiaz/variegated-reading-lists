> Slippy Map is, in general, a term referring to modern web maps which let you zoom and pan around (the map slips around when you drag the mouse).

> Apart from very limited testing purposes, you should not use the tiles supplied
by OpenStreetMap.org itself. OpenStreetMap is a volunteer-run non-profit body
and cannot supply tiles for large-scale commercial use. Rather, you should use
a third party provider that makes tiles from OSM data, or generate your own. 

> Serving your own maps is a fairly intensive task. Depending on the size of the
area you’re interested in serving and the traffic you expect the system
requirements will vary. In general, requirements will range from 10-20GB of
storage, 4GB of memory, and a modern dual-core processor for a city-sized
region to 300GB+ of fast storage, 24GB of memory, and a quad-core processor for
the entire planet.

> We would recommend that you begin with extracts of OpenStreetMap data – for
example, a city, county or small country – rather than spending a week
importing the whole world (planet.osm) and then having to restart because of a
configuration mistake!
