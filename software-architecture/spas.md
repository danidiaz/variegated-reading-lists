> Storage mechanisms are unsafe

> Token lifetimes should be kept short

> Because of the issues outlined above, the best security recommendation for an
> SPA is to avoid keeping tokens in the browser at all. This can be achieved
> with the help of a lightweight back-end component, often described as a
> Backend-For-Frontend.

> The backend component can then be configured as a confidential OAuth client
> and used to keep tokens away from the browser. It can either be stateful and
> keep tokens in custom storage, or stateless and store the tokens in encrypted
> HTTP-only, same-site cookies. Whichever variant is chosen, the backend
> component creates a session for the SPA, using HTTP-only, secure, same-site
> cookies, thus enabling a high level of security. Such cookies cannot be read
> by scripts and are limited to the domain of the SPA
