- [Andrew Plotkin's Shade](http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/glassdark)

> One example is the treatment of navigation. IFs are traditionally navigable by compass rose (N, S, E, W), with objects and events distributed in space as an exploration. Shade, by contrast, eschews navigation for a single location. Subtitled “a one-room game set in your apartment,” Shade is playfully referring to the phenomenon of apartment pieces in IF - generally learner works in which authors new to the medium begin by scrupulously implementing a detailed model of everything within sight of their desks. Such pieces usually lack setting, conflict, and/or plot, tending instead to concentrate on the detailed execution of conventionally modeled IF objects - an interactive lamp, cabinet, closet, and so on.

> Just as Shade opted out of conventional light modeling, it dispenses with conventional spatial navigation. Instead, the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom of the apartment form one unified location - a contiguous “room” with several “nooks,” whose objects are always in scope. The player location is indicated through nuance and shifting emphasis. Interacting with something in the one area automatically shifts the player to that area, while the view is reorganized to describe nearer objects before those further away. The net effect is a feeling of differentiated space without rigid underlying zones.

> tldr; I argue that compass-based navigation in parser IF is mostly an unintended accident of the earliest adventure games, that--in most circumstances--compass-based navigation spoils the illusion, and I mull whether it's worth experimenting with landmark-based navigation.

> You are not the first (or tenth) person to suggest that compass directions are artificial and break the illusion of place, but no alternative has ever hung on for more than one game in a row.

Instead you need to seek to create the impression that off-screen characters are still acting. By reducing the amount of update characters that are off-screen receive you can dramatically increase processing times.

> It's a lot easier to travel off trail in areas with hills and hollows than flat lands with little variation in terrain and flora, and a compass makes a huge difference in that case, but even then stopping and turning around to look for something even a bit out of the ordinary can make a huge difference in rather you begin to panic over being lost or not.

> I started amid a big cluster of rocks, an archipelago or a neighborhood of rock piles each the size of a huge building; like buildings they cut off views, so you have to know the lay of the land and local landmarks rather than counting on distant sights to steer by as in other deserts.

> Mountain ranges appeared and disappeared on the horizon as I rotated around the plain and returned to the rocks.

> wind-carved pillars of red stone studding a hot, airless expanse of sand and gravel and ruddy dirt stretching to the red cliffs in the distance.

> A path is a prior interpretation of the best way to traverse a landscape, and to follow a route is to accept an interpretation,

> Part of what makes roads, trails, and paths so unique as built structures is that they cannot be perceived as a whole all at once by a sedentary onlooker.

> At distance heard the murmur of many waterfalls not audible in the day-time.

> (in this context, “a walk” meant a path broad enough for two to walk abreast; it could be called a conversational route).

> Renaissance Italian gardens had been built by preference upon slopes that gave views of the countryside beyond, connecting the garden to the world, but French and English gardens seldom had such settings. The line of sight only extended to the garden wall,

> “Whereas the French formal garden was based on a single axial view from the house, the English garden was a series of multiple oblique views that were meant to be experienced while one walked through it.”

> Walks are everywhere in Pride and Prejudice. The heroine walks on every possible occasion and in every location, and many of the crucial encounters and conversations in the book take place while two characters are walking together.

> Already over the final pass and still thinking they had far higher to go, they had cut off on an uphill trail when a peasant set them straight and sent them to finish their descent into Italy, where they made a quick loop past Lake Como before reentering Switzerland.

> shepherds were among the first mountain guides in Europe—leads

> A lone peak or high point is a natural focal point in the landscape, something by which both travelers and locals orient themselves. In the continuum of landscape, mountains are discontinuity—culminating high points, natural barriers, unearthly earth.

> Cities fascinated him as a kind of organization that could only be perceived by wandering or by browsing, a spatial order in contrast to the tidily linear temporal order of narratives and chronologies.

> “Narrow crevices,” Victor Hugo calls “those obscure, contracted, angular lanes, bordered by ruins eight stories high. . . . The street was narrow and the gutter wide, the passerby walked along a pavement which was always wet, beside shops that were like cellars, great stone blocks encircled with iron, immense garbage heaps.

> a stranger to these new boulevards that go straight on, without meandering, without the adventures of perspective. . . .”

> Now plump and afflicted with heart trouble that even on the streets of Paris had made him stop every few minutes,

> Kenneth Jackson outlines what he calls “the walking city” that preceded the development of middle-class suburbs: it was densely populated; it had “a clear distinction between city and country,” often by means of walls or some other abrupt periphery;

> The Strip is not the Champs-Élysées reborn for other reasons too; it lacks the perfect straightness Le Nôtre gave the older road, the straightness that lets you see far into the distance. It bends and bulges, though there are always the cross-streets—and the bridge over Flamingo Road between Bellagio and Caesars provided the best view yet of the desert to the west and Red Rocks.

> Repetition: repetition in text can get quite jarring if the text is written like a novel, as opposed to the classic RPG way of displaying it as a text log. It's not unsolvable, but it certainly is difficult. Not only does avoiding repetition require knowledge of previously generated text, I think it also requires adjustments to the game world itself. It can't be Skyrim in that regard, it needs to generate unique and meaningful situations.

## Quotes

[Suburbia](https://qz.com/698928/why-suburbia-sucks/)

> The geometry of streets and sidewalks is a critical topic. Generally speaking, the reason settled streets in older neighborhoods and European cities feel “cozy” and “charming” is because they provide a feeling of enclosure, which humans want because it gives them with a coherent sense of place, like rooms in a house.

> I’m not a sociobiologist and cannot say exactly why this is, but would speculate that it caters to people’s primal need for shelter and clear directional orientation. Whatever the case, it’s an established fact that people gravitate toward places that have clear borders and relatively comprehensive enclosures; it’s a kind of axiom for the discipline of architecture. People feel vulnerable and uncomfortable in open areas with ill-defined margins.

Walter Benjamin:

> Not to find one's way around a city does not mean much. But to lose one's way in a city, as one loses one's way in a forest, requires some schooling. Street names must speak to the urban wanderer like the snapping of dry twigs, and little streets in the heart of the city must reflect the times of day, for him, as clearly as a mountain valley. This art I acquired rather late in life; it fulfilled a dream, of which the first traces were labyrinths on the blotting papers in my school notebooks.

[Shahnameh:](https://twitter.com/tadeuscalinca/status/995620987239653376)

> He saw a mass of ruins with an archway that was still standing. High, ancient, and crumbling, it looked as if it had once been part of a royal edifice

Du cote de Guermantes

> m’était toujours apparu comme une transparente verrerie, sous laquelle je voyais, frappés au bord de la mer violette par les rayons obliques d’un soleil d’or, les cubes roses d’une cité antique

Bishops in flight

> The Canopica Way, a central avenue, cut through the city form the Moon Gate to the Sun Gate (east to west). The Soma was a central street that spanned from the harbor to Lake Mareotis (north to south).

Albertine disparue

> Je m’étais engagé dans un réseau de petites ruelles, de calli divisant en tous sens, de leurs rainures, le morceau de Venise découpé entre un canal et la lagune, comme s’il avait cristallisé suivant ces formes innombrables, ténues et minutieuses. Tout à coup, au bout d’une de ces petites rues, il semblait que dans la matière cristallisée se fût produite une distension. Un vaste et somptueux campo à qui je n’eusse assurément pas, dans ce réseau de petites rues, pu deviner cette importance, ni même trouver une place, s’étendait devant moi entouré de charmants palais pâles de clair de lune. C’était un de ces ensembles architecturaux vers lesquels, dans une autre ville, les rues se dirigent, vous conduisent et le désignent. Ici, il semblait exprès caché dans un entre-croisement de ruelles, comme ces palais des contes orientaux où on mène la nuit un personnage qui, ramené chez lui avant le jour, ne doit pas pouvoir retrouver la demeure magique où il finit par croire qu’il n’est allé qu’en rêve.

Don't remember the title

> Diodorus Siculus (fl. 49 B.C.) concurs, stressing the magnificence and magnitude of the Egyptian maze, whose artistic carvings, ceiling paintings, relics, and murals would have made it insurpassable in execution, had it ever been finished.

> Not surprisingly, Pliny finds it impossible to describe precisely the ground plan of this complex building with its winding passages, vast halls, and temples.

> Even with a guide, Herodotus experienced “countless marvelings” at the Egyptian maze’s “extreme complication,” and he never penetrated the dangerous lower chambers inhabited by dead kings and sacred crocodiles.

> some of the maze’s functions: as a tomb (later associations will be with death or with hell); as an elaborate memorial to sponsor or builder; as a place of worship or judgment; as a place requiring a guide; as a fitting habitat for monsters, whether painted (as in Pliny) or real (as in Herodotus); as an image of deceptiveness; and as a building intricately designed to protect from intruders what lies within.

> Isidore treats labyrinths under the rubric “public buildings,” along with gymnasia, circuses, amphitheaters, and towers.

[Trees in the Middle Ages](https://www.medievalists.net/2015/06/trees-in-the-middle-ages/)

> In his book, Trees in the Religions of Early Medieval England, Michael D.J. Bintley explains that “trees in the Anglo-Saxon England marked meeting places where significant political decisions were made throughout the period, by both violent and peaceful methods.”

Bernini, his life and his Rome

> Between the populated urban core and the rings of walls was the wide swath of the rural disabitato (uninhabited zone) filled with vineyards and patrician villas. Naturally, the disabitato also afforded Romans the privacy and space for the kinds of interpersonal activities, legal (courting, partying) or otherwise (rape, kidnapping, homicide), that could not be carried out as easily in the town center under constant surveillance by police and nosy neighbors.

[Quelle place pour les voix humaines dans le Paris du XVIIIe siècle ?](https://twitter.com/DiazCarrete/status/1273293723661729793)

> in Pittsburgh, even if you can see it, it doesn’t mean you can get there from where you are, especially not by taking what seems to be the obvious route.

> You can roll, backstep, walk or sprint out of hitboxes or you can roll through attacks, utilizing a roll's iframes.

> Iframes are invincibility frames [...] times in which you are invincible. The most obvious examples are when you are riposting or backstabbing an enemy and another enemy is attacking you, but you receive no damage. This also applies to pulling levers.

> With regards to rolling, you receive iframes while rolling, which is why you see players rolling THROUGH the attacks of enemies, as they are invincible during that time, they will not take damage from the attack. The number of iframes you receive while rolling, or to put it another way, the amount of time you are invincible while rolling, is dependent on your equip load.

> Being able to take advantage of these iframes is a key mechanic of Dark Souls and is viewed, tactically, as more advantageous than using a shield to simply block an attack rather than rolling through it. 

> For one, it's not just an avoidance technique in games. It also covers distance, allowing players to re-position themselves in a big way or even briefly disengage from combat entirely. This makes for a greater range of possible tactical maneuvers and—on top of that—players can move out of striking range and readjust, rethink their attack plan, if need be. Combat can be overwhelming. The dodge roll is a remedy to that.

> It's also satisfying. All that motion, all that power, smooshed into a tiny man-ball shaped explosion of movement. It feels good—arguably better than a quick side or back-step

> i get what you're saying, making dodging more realistic, but in this type of game you just can't capture the subtle nuances of a real fight. you need a standardised way of dodging that has a fairly obvious (lol, i know...) linear adjustment.

> The word itself is of french origin.[1] Octroi taxes have a respectable antiquity, being known in Roman times as vectigalia. These vectigalia were either the portorium, a tax on the entry from or departure to the provinces (those cities which were allowed to levy the portorium shared the profits with the public treasury); the ansarium or foricarium, a duty levied at the entrance to towns
